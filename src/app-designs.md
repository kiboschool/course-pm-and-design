## Brief
By now, your team has:
- Completed the concept test report, and have a product direction
- Completed the individual design replication assignment and praticed UI design  with Figma. 

For this project, your squad will design and submit **at least** four pages of your proposed solution. Your solution should be either a website **or** mobile application. The solution your squad decides to move forward with should be based on the takeaways you got from participants‚Äô feedback.


## Guidance

- Before beginning the visual design
  - Sketch out the pages you want to design using Figjam or any other whiteboard collaboration tool you prefer. The sketches don't have to look good. They need to clearly highlight the feature/s you're designing so that as a squad, you all understand how your solution will work.
- Agree on the design direction with your squad before you start designing in Figma. This will help reduce disagreements once you're designing the UI.
  - Design direction to agree on include your solutions name, the brand colors for your solution, the typeface for your brand, etc.
  - Once you have a design direction, jump into Figma and start designing. 
- Decide on an approach to split up the work
  - Each member of the squad must design at least one page
  - The rest of the design may be split up however you wish. For example, one person may be delegated to design the rest of the pages while others focus on other aspects of the final project. But it is critical that each person design at least one page 

## Submission

#### (1) Update the permissions of your Figma file so that anyone with the link can view

To do so:

- Click on the "Share" button in the top right hand corner of Figma
- In the modal that pops-up, ensure that the "Anyone with the link" option is set to "Can View" rather than "can edit"
- Finally, click on the "Copy link" button at the bottom of the modal


#### (2) Submit your assignment in Gradescope

Submit the link to your design on Gradescope. Note that **this is a Gradescope group assignment** and so one person should submit and choose your team members


#### (3) Submit a collaboration evaluation
Submit <a href="https://forms.gle/QcYXFq5SysjjaH3RA" target="_blank"> this form </a>to summarize your contribution and that of your team members. The form will ask you to answer the following questions about your collaboration:
 -  Summarize your individual contribution to this group assignment/project.
 -  How balanced were the efforts of the group members? Did everyone do his or her fair share of work?
-  If you had done this by yourself, would the outcome have been better or worse?
-  Given the choice, would you work with the same group again?
 -  (Optional) Is there anything else you want to share with instructors about the way your team worked together?



#### (4) Download and submit PDF copies of your designs in Woolf

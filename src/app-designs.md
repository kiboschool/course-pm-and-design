## Brief
From your assignments in previous lessons and in-class activities, your squad should have:

 - Chosen a ‚ÄúHow Might We‚Äù
 - Ideated solutions in the form of ‚ÄúCan We‚Äù
 - Created concepts based on your ‚ÄúCan We‚Äù
 - Tested these concepts with your classmates

For this project, you‚Äôll test your concepts with people outside of the course and Kibo School (real participants). The goal is for you to experience how to create research assets, recruit research participants, carry out research, gather feedback and generate actionable insights/takeaways from feedback. 

You are required to conduct 3-5 concept tests with different participants in your target audience. During a concept test, one squad member will act as a facilitator by guiding the participant through the concept test while the other squad members take notes and support in whatever capacity is needed. Each squad member should facilitate at least one concept test. 


## Tools
It‚Äôs important that you organize and gatheer all the tools you need to make your concept tests are as seamless as possible for both your squad and participants. Below are the tools you‚Äôll need to carry out your concept test successfully;

 - Your concepts in Google slides 
 - Google docs or whichever document tool you‚Äôre comfortable with. This will be used to document; the script which will narrate what the facilitator will say,  the questions which will be asked during the interview and for taking notes during the interview. Each squad should make a copy of [this script]() template and edit as they see fit.
 - Google Calendar or whichever calendar tool you‚Äôre comfortable with to schedule dates and times for your concept tests with participants
 - Zoom/Google Meet or which every video calling tool you‚Äôre comfortable with to carry out your concept tests and record the interview
 - If you can't record on Zoom/Google Meet - a video recorder (you can use the video recorder on your PC for this)


## Step 1: Recruit Research Participants

With your interview script, concept tests and questions prepared, you‚Äôre ready to start recruiting participants. Feel free to recruit participants from wherever you can. The most important thing is that you agree on a time and date that‚Äôs comfortable for both participants and your squad members. As you try to recruit participants, be sure to let them know what you're recruiting them for (concept testing) and how much of their time you need (each concept test should last for no longer than 30 mins). You‚Äôll also need to be sure that you send calendar invites that include the date, time and  link that will be used for the video call to participants so that they know when and how to join the call. 


## Step 2: Carry out Concept Tests

While carrying out the concept test, try not to ask closed questions so you don't influence participants' responses. Give participants enough time to respond but also make sure they don‚Äôt take too much time, remember you only have 30 mins. 


## Hints and Guidance

Be sure to record the call so that you can go back to it when you‚Äôre analyzing the feedback and generating takeaways. One of your squad mates should also be taking notes. The notes don't need to be perfect since you have recordings to go back to.  


## Submission

The final submission for this assignment will be in week 5. You‚Äôll be required to submit a concept test report containing;

 - The roles each of your squad member held during each concept test 
 - The number of people that participated in your concepts tests
 - The dates and times of your concept tests
 - The script you used and questions you asked
 - A summary of the feedback you got during your concept tests 
 - The takeaways you generated from the feedback you got

Use [this template]() to create your concept test report. Please try your best to keep the concept test report short.

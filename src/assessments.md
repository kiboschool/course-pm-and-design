# Assessments and Grading
---

There are six assessments in the course, including the final project. The majority of your assessments are milestones toward your final project. Because your work in this course builds on itself, it is critical that you work on projects throughout the term, and not wait until the end.

## Assessment and Grading Summary

The table below summarizes how your grades for the course is calculated.

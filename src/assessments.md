# Assessments and Grading

This course will teach you how to go from idea to development-ready software product. You will begin with a user problem (in the form of a "how might we" problem statement). You will then ideate solutions, conduct user research, then craft a UI prototype and product requirements document. The majority of your assessments are milestones toward your final project.

There are six assessments total in the course, including the final project. Each assessment and its share towards your final grade is summarized below:

### Concept Creation (10%)

# Assessments and Grading
---

This course will teach you how to go from idea to development-ready software product. You will begin with a user problem (in the form of a "how might we" problem statement). You will then ideate solutions, conduct user research, then craft a UI prototype and product requirements document. There are six assessments total in the course, including the final project. The majority of your assessments are milestones toward your final project.

### Assessment Details

#### Concept Creation (10%)
Choose an "How Might We" problem and create concepts for user testing<br> 

#### Design replication (5%)
Replicate the design of one screen of a mobile app<br>

#### Final Project Milestone 1: concept testing (20%)
Refine your product concepts, then conduct user tests with 3-5 users in the target audience. Submit a research report summarizing the results of your concept tests and planned changes to your product vision.<br>

#### Information Architecture (5%)

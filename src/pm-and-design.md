## What you'll learn

This course will teach you how to build products users want and love. It gives you a 
foundation in the tools and practices of modern product management and 
interaction design.  You will collaborate with peers to apply these product development skills 
to real user challenges. 

The course begins with a focus on user research. You'll learn and apply the 
design thinking framework to product development. You'll learn to define user 
needs through user interviews and market analysis,  to translate those needs into product specifications, and define metrics to test 
product success. Next you'll learn to create and test design prototypes 
(wireframes, user journeys). You'll learn key concepts in UI/UX design including information 
hierarchy, and typography and color. You will create high-fidelity UI mockups 
using industry-standard tools. You’ll  conduct usability tests to gauge the 
effectiveness of your designs. 

Working with your peers, you will practice the complementary and collaborative 
roles of PMs and UX designers in early product development. You’ll also practice 
giving design critiques to other teams, and responding to feedback on your 
designs. By the end of the courses, your team will have a user-tested, refined, 
and development-ready spec for a web or mobile application.

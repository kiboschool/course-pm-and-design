## Brief
In the last two chapters you‚Äôve been introduced to UI design, UI design principles and designing for mobile and web. Under the ‚ÄúInspiration and Resources‚Äù section we‚Äôve also covered how important it is to seek out sources of inspiration and replicate/copy other designs/designers. 

For this assignment, you‚Äôll be expected to replicate one app or website screen from a product of your choice as we did during the live lesson. This is an individual assignment. The goal is for you to;

- Familiarize yourself with the different features and functionalities within Figma
- Get comfortable designing the elements/components that are necessary for you to properly replicate designs 
- Train your eyes to spot differences/inconsistencies in designs


## Hints and Guidiance

- Take a screenshot of the app or full web page you plan on replicating
- Post the screenshot in Figma and resize as needed
- Create your design right next to the screenshot so that you can constantly compare your design with it as you progress


## Submission

#### (1) Update the permissions of your Figma file so that anyone with the link can view

To do so:

- Click on the "Share" button in the top right hand corner of Figma
- In the modal that pops-up, ensure that the "Anyone with the link" option is set to "Can View" rather than "can edit"
- Finally, click on the "Copy link" button at the bottom of the modal


#### (2) Submit your assignment in Gradescope

Submit the link to your design on Gradescope


#### (3) Download and submit a PDF copy of your design in Woolf

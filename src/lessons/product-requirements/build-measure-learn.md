When we think of successful products like Google Search, Facebook or Spotify, it's easy to forget their modest beginnings. <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-v7DViedN0Yg/VZrSQMObrDI/AAAAAAAAF74/cYOjPg3Gtis/s1600/FirstVersions_Twitter-interface-Nov2006.png" target="_blank">Here</a> is an image of the very first version of twitter in 2006. The first version of Facebook, then called "The facebook" launched in 2004 and was restricted to just students at Harvard. Its only feature was a profile page and the ability to friend smeone. Many of the features we now associated with Facebook and social networking -- from photo sharing to News Feed or status updates -- came many years after the original launch. 

The art of the launch is tricky. Figuring out what to release and what not to release is difficult. That's why Reid Hoffman, CEO of LinkedIn has a famous quote:

First impressions matter and in many aspects of life, carefully tending to the first impression is critical. Yet, in software product development, we have to balance our desire for polish with our desire to learn. The only way to truly learn if a product will meet user needs is to give the product to users. So, most software developers today follow a lean approach which advocates for releasing a bare-minium version of the product, learning from users, then iterating based on user feedback.  


## Build, Measure, Learn

"Build, measure, learn" is a concept from the lean startup methodology, which is a framework for developing and growing businesses that emphasizes rapid experimentation and iteration. The lean startup methodology is a framework for developing and growing businesses that emphasizes rapid experimentation and iteration. It was developed by Eric Ries and is based on the idea that businesses can use small, rapid experiments to test and validate their assumptions about their customers and markets. Key principles of the lean startup methodology include the "build, measure, learn" cycle, the minimum viable product, and customer development. It is often used in conjunction with agile software development methodologies and has become popular among startups and small businesses as well as larger companies.

It involves a cycle of building a product or feature, measuring how well it performs, and learning from the results in order to make improvements.

Here's how the "build, measure, learn" cycle works:

Build: This step involves creating a product or feature. It can be as simple as a prototype or as complex as a fully-fledged product. The idea is to get something tangible to test as quickly as possible, even if it is not fully polished or complete.

Measure: Once you have built something, the next step is to measure how well it performs. This can involve gathering data on how users interact with the product, analyzing metrics such as conversion rates or user engagement, and soliciting feedback from customers or users.

Learn: Based on the data and feedback you collect, the next step is to learn from the results and make changes to the product or feature as needed. This can involve making improvements, abandoning ideas that aren't working, or pivoting to a different direction altogether.

The "build, measure, learn" cycle is designed to be repeated continuously in order to quickly and efficiently identify what works and what doesn't, and to iterate and improve based on real-world data. The goal is to build a product that meets the needs and desires of the target audience as effectively as possible.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡  Thought it is popularly called "Build, Measure, Learn" a good way to think about this framework is actually "Learn, Build, Measure." As we've been discussing throughout the course, user-centric design starts with learning about users, then building and testing prototypes.

There are a few reasons why "learn, build, measure" might be a better way to think about the "build, measure, learn" cycle:

Learning comes first: By starting with the "learn" step, you prioritize the process of gathering and analyzing data and feedback, which is essential for making informed decisions about what to build and how to measure its performance. By starting with learning, you can ensure that you are building and measuring the right things, rather than just building and measuring for the sake of it.

It aligns with the scientific method: The "learn, build, measure" sequence aligns more closely with the scientific method, which involves making observations, forming hypotheses, testing hypotheses, and analyzing results. This can help to make the process of product development more systematic and structured, and can lead to more reliable and accurate results.

It promotes continuous improvement: By starting with learning and iterating through the cycle continuously, you can ensure that you are continually gathering data and feedback and using it to make improvements. This can help to promote a culture of continuous improvement, which can be important for staying competitive in today's fast-paced business environment.

That being said, there is no one "right" way to think about the "build, measure, learn" cycle, and the sequence of steps can vary depending on the specific needs and goals of a business or product.





## What is User Experience (UX) Research?
User experience research is a critical part of the design process. 

UX research is the process of studying the behaviors, needs, attitudes and motivations of users in order to improve the design of software, services or products. UX researchers conduct various types of research, including interviews, surveys, usability tests in order to gather data from users and identifies opportunites for impact. 


  

## Quantitative vs. qualitative research
Two main types of UX research methods are quantitative and qualitative. 


### Quantitative research 
Quantiative UX research focuses on collecting and analyzing numerical data. This can include surveys, polls, usage logs, or other methods of data collection that provide numerical data which can be analyzed using statistical techniques. Quantitative research is useful to generate a large amount of data from a large sample size, and to make generalizations about a user group or population. This type of research is often used to test hypotheses and identify trends or patterns in user behavior. Some types of questions a UX researcher might answers with quantiative research include:
- How many active users does the product have each day or each month?
- What share of people find the call to action on the page?
- What is the average satisfaction level of users with the product or service?

### Qualitative research

Qualitative UX research focuses on understanding user experiences and behaviors in a more in-depth and nuanced way. This type of research typically involves conducting interviews, focus groups, observations, or other forms of data collection that allow researchers to probe users' thoughts, feelings, and experiences in greater detail. Qualitative research often involves smaller sample sizes and is used to generate rich, detailed insights into user behavior and preferences.

Qualitative ux research differs from quantitative research in that it is less focused on collecting and analyzing numerical data. Instead, it focuses on understanding the underlying reasons behind user behavior and preferences, and on exploring the subjective experiences of users. This type of research is often used to identify trends or patterns that may not be immediately apparent from numerical data, and to gain a deeper understanding of user motivations and behaviors.

## Attitudinal vs. behaviorial research

Another set of research methods is attitudinal vs. behaviorial. The difference in these two approaches draws from the insight that what people say and believe, i.e., their attitudes, are often different from what they actually do, i.e., their behavior. In order to build impactful products, it's important to understand both what your users believe and how they behave. 



### Attitudinal research 
Attitudinal research focuses on understanding the attitudes and beliefs of a user. It typically involves conducting surveys, interviews, or other forms of data collection that allow researchers to explore people's attitudes and beliefs in greater detail. This type of research is often used to identify potential problems or issues with a product or service, to gauge the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, or to understand the underlying reasons behind people's attitudes and beliefs.

### Behaviorial research

Behavioral research focuses on understanding the actions and behaviors of users in relation to a particular product or service. It typically includes studies of how users interact with the product or service, how they navigate through different features or pages, or how they respond to different design elements. Behavioral research might involve tracking their actions and behaviors through the use of tools like heat maps or click tracking software. This type of research is often used to identify areas for improvement in a product or service, to understand user behavior and preferences, or to inform the design of future products or services.

## UX Design principle 1: Mix it up!
ðŸ’¡ When conducting research, use a mix of both quantitative and qualitiative research, as well as a mix of attitudinal and behavioral approaches. This enables you to get the clearest and most naunced view of a design problem.

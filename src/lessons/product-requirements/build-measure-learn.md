"Build, measure, learn" is a concept from the lean startup methodology, which is a framework for developing and growing businesses that emphasizes rapid experimentation and iteration. The lean startup methodology is a framework for developing and growing businesses that emphasizes rapid experimentation and iteration. It was developed by Eric Ries and is based on the idea that businesses can use small, rapid experiments to test and validate their assumptions about their customers and markets. Key principles of the lean startup methodology include the "build, measure, learn" cycle, the minimum viable product, and customer development. It is often used in conjunction with agile software development methodologies and has become popular among startups and small businesses as well as larger companies.

It involves a cycle of building a product or feature, measuring how well it performs, and learning from the results in order to make improvements.

Here's how the "build, measure, learn" cycle works:

Build: This step involves creating a product or feature. It can be as simple as a prototype or as complex as a fully-fledged product. The idea is to get something tangible to test as quickly as possible, even if it is not fully polished or complete.

Measure: Once you have built something, the next step is to measure how well it performs. This can involve gathering data on how users interact with the product, analyzing metrics such as conversion rates or user engagement, and soliciting feedback from customers or users.

Learn: Based on the data and feedback you collect, the next step is to learn from the results and make changes to the product or feature as needed. This can involve making improvements, abandoning ideas that aren't working, or pivoting to a different direction altogether.

The "build, measure, learn" cycle is designed to be repeated continuously in order to quickly and efficiently identify what works and what doesn't, and to iterate and improve based on real-world data. The goal is to build a product that meets the needs and desires of the target audience as effectively as possible.

ðŸ’¡  Thought it is popularly called "Build, Measure, Learn" a good way to think about this framework is actually "Learn, Build, Measure." As we've been discussing throughout the course, user-centric design starts with learning about users, then building and testing prototypes.

There are a few reasons why "learn, build, measure" might be a better way to think about the "build, measure, learn" cycle:

Learning comes first: By starting with the "learn" step, you prioritize the process of gathering and analyzing data and feedback, which is essential for making informed decisions about what to build and how to measure its performance. By starting with learning, you can ensure that you are building and measuring the right things, rather than just building and measuring for the sake of it.

It aligns with the scientific method: The "learn, build, measure" sequence aligns more closely with the scientific method, which involves making observations, forming hypotheses, testing hypotheses, and analyzing results. This can help to make the process of product development more systematic and structured, and can lead to more reliable and accurate results.

It promotes continuous improvement: By starting with learning and iterating through the cycle continuously, you can ensure that you are continually gathering data and feedback and using it to make improvements. This can help to promote a culture of continuous improvement, which can be important for staying competitive in today's fast-paced business environment.

That being said, there is no one "right" way to think about the "build, measure, learn" cycle, and the sequence of steps can vary depending on the specific needs and goals of a business or product.



## The danger of big bang delivery
What's so wrong with buiding out an entire software product, then delivering it to users. This approach, sometimes called "big bang delivery" _might_ seem reasonable on the surface. 

Big bang delivery is a software development method in which all of the features and functionality of a software product are delivered to the user at once, rather than being released in increments or stages. The idea is to deliver everything that the user needs all at once, so that they can begin using the software and achieving their desired outcomes as quickly as possible.

There are some potential advantages to big bang delivery, including:

1. Reduced development time: By delivering everything at once, there is less time spent on development and more time spent on use.

2. Reduced costs: Big bang delivery can potentially reduce costs by eliminating the need for multiple releases, which can involve additional development and testing efforts.

3. Improved user experience: By delivering everything that the user needs all at once, there is less waiting and fewer interruptions to the user's workflow.

However, there are also some potential drawbacks to big bang delivery. For example:
- Deployment risk: It can be risky to deliver everything at once, as there is a greater chance of encountering bugs or other issues that can impact the user's experience.
- Estimation/prediction It can be difficult to accurately predict and plan for all of the features and functionality that a user will need in advance, which can lead to missed opportunities or an incomplete product.
- Concentrated risk -- no opportunity to course correct

As a result, big bang delivery is not always the best approach for software development, and it may be more appropriate in some situations than in others. It is important to carefully consider the specific needs and goals of a project and the potential risks and benefits of different delivery methods before deciding on the best approach.


Instead of the Big Bang Delivery, iterative development and phased rollout is the right approach. Companies today generally focus on delivering a "minimum viable product" or MVP, i.e., a  minimal, stripped-down version of a product that can be released to users in order to gather data and feedback as quickly as possible. It is not intended to be a fully-fledged product, but rather a means of testing and gathering data on the product's core value proposition.

In the next lesson, we'll explore one of the trickiest parts of lean software development: crafting the ideal MVP>

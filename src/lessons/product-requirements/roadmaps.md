  ðŸ—£ **"The minimum viable product was appealing because it was cheap, and you could get it to market faster. But weâ€™ve advanced past a world where products are â€˜the first of X.â€™ Stiffer competition means that MVPs arenâ€™t going to cut it anymore. If startups truly want to stand out, they need to strive toward creating a minimum lovable product instead."** 
  â€” JZ Zhang, VP of Product at Webflow and formerly Airbnb

In the previous lesson, we learned about the MVP or minimum viable product. The main goal of an MVP is to enable product teams to launch a first version to test with real users. In this lesson, we'll discuss how to move beyond an MVP and plan versions of you product that users are willing to pay for with their money and time.

### MVP, MMP, MLP....what?!?

As explained in the video:
- ðŸš€ An MVP is the version that goes beyond a prototype and helps the team collect validated data from customers with a minimal amount of effort
- ðŸ«¶ An MLP is a version of your product that delights the user and helps you gain a loyal following. It concentrates on _differentiated_ features that are important to users
- ðŸ’° An MMP or minimum marketable product includes a "baseline" or mimimum set of features required for a product of its class

Product managers create and maintain roadmaps. A good roadmap will:
- **Describe** the product strategy and vision
- **Guides** development and execution of product strategy
- **Aligns** the product team  
- **Facilitates** discussions of options for the product
- **Communicates** with internal and external stakeholders


Planning a product roadmap is tricky, and it takes years of working as a product manager to master this. There is no one size fits all approach/ Figuring out the product roadmap is one of the marks of a senior product manager and truly requires operating at the intersection. You may recall the image below from the lesson on [What is Product Management](/lessons/software-team/what-is-pm):

Determining the roadmap for the product is an important decision and impacts many stakeholders. PMs have to make a case for a strategy and align the company on the strategy based on:
- The user needs, and features that matter most to users and customers
- The business needs, the sustainability of the business, and the competitive environment
- The technology resources available 

### Tips for building a roadmap
- Focus on why: talk to your early adopters regularly. Find out why they use the product, and how t makes them feel. Use _qualitative_ research methods that help you gain a depth of understanding, not just yes/no surveys
- Understand what makes you lovable: as a new product, it is unlikely that you will have feature parity with all of the incumbents. So, it's important to discover your unique value proposition, align your team on it, and build from a position of strength. 
- Iterate and stay lean: every feature you add a product has a compounding cost. As you buid your roadmap, especially in the earliest years, consider what is truly _minimum_ required to delight your users and build as little as possible 

For early stage products, simple roadmaps without dates that focus on key themes are best. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1e8IXhSMGBr-EMdVvuHOlX6qfgNINvby5_FRDNIMQmZg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> Here is a simple roadmap template </a> that you may use for your projects. Note that the template has two features per stage for illustrative purposes only! Your roadmap may have more or fewer features in each state of development.

## What We Learned

- Build, Measure, Learn is a useful product development framework in which teams build a product or feature, measure how well it performs, then use results to make improvements
- The minimum viable product or MVP is the earliest testable version of a product that solves a problem. Its primary goal is to learn
- Teams must go beyond MVPs to think about a  version of the product that meetings market expectation (Minimum Marketable Product or MMP) and a version of the product that delights the user with differentiated feature (Minimum Lovable Product or MLP)
- A product requirements document is an important document that aligns stakeholders, and answers three key questions: 
  - Why are we building this product?
  - What should the product do?
  - How do we measure the success of the product.

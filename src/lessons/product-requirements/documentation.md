  ðŸ—£ **"The minimum viable product was appealing because it was cheap, and you could get it to market faster. But weâ€™ve advanced past a world where products are â€˜the first of X.â€™ Stiffer competition means that MVPs arenâ€™t going to cut it anymore. If startups truly want to stand out, they need to strive toward creating a minimum lovable product instead."**

A key part of a product manager's role is leading the engineering and design teams to launch products or features. The key document used to drive alignment and ensure the product is built the right way is the product requirements document (PRD). In this lesson, we discuss why PRDs are, how to write one, and share some examples. 

## Why documentation matters
In general, product managers spend a lot of time writing and maintaining product documentation. These documents help internal teams align on the product vision, strategy, features, go-to-market approach, and more. PMs write different types of documentation, including:
- One-pager: these are short documents, ideally but rarely 1 page, that explain a product or feature idea. One-pagers are useful to summarize the key parts of a project or product. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1541V32QgSwyCFWxtiMIThn-6n-2s7fVWztEWVa970uo/edit" target="_blank">Here</a> is a great template of a 1-pager by product leader Lenny Rachitsky. 
- Product requirements document (PRD): PRDs are longer documents that help create a shared understanding of the product. PRDs are used by various members of a product team including:
  - UX designers to understand the product vision and create wireframes and designers
  - Engineers to inform and guide their engineering work. At large companies like Google, software engineers will often use the PRD to create an "Engineering Design document," a more technical document that refers back to the PRD and outlines technical design of the product
  - QA (quality assurance) team members to write test cases and ensure the finished product meets the requiremetns
  - Product marketers to understand the vision, and create campaigns or launch plans

Documentation is fundamentally a tool for collaboration, and driving clarity across the team.

## Writing a PRD
A PRD attempts to answer 3 key questions:
1. Why are we building this product?
2. What should the product do?
3. How do we measure the success of the product. 

Some companies or teams have very specific templates they use for PRDs. In other companies, the exact format varies. Regardless, there are certain sections which are common to most PRDs:
- Problem the product is trying to solve
- Summary of the proposed solutions
- Goals of the solution
- Key Features or user flows
- Launch release milestones
- Success Metrics

Here are a few examples of PRDs templates from different companies

### Maintaining a PRD
<aside> ðŸ’¡A PRD is a living document
  </aside>
The best ones are "living documents," i.e., they are regularly updated and maintained throughout the lifecycle of a product as the team iterates and changes. It's not uncommon for PRDs to start out relatively small (perhaps just a bit longer than a 1-pager) then evolve as the team begins to build and clarifies the requirements

## Read it: find information in a PRD

 Reading PRDs can be a useful way to learn to write one. Review <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yrU5F6Gxhkfma91wf_IbZfexw8_fahbGQLW3EvwdfQI/edit", target="_blank"> this PRD</a> which was written for the first version of <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/", target="blank">Product Hunt</a>, a platform for discovery new tech product. Then  answer at least one of the questions below.

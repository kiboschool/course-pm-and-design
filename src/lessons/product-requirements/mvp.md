  ðŸ—£ **"Products that target a large market donâ€™t usually start by boiling the ocean. They build incrementally after finding a hugely valuable solution to a single pain point. Itâ€™s too easy to look at a company after itâ€™s scaled and believe the opposite - that they started with it all."** â€” Hiten Shah, Founder of KISSmetrics

First impressions matter and in many aspects of life, carefully tending to the first impression is critical. Yet, in software product development, we have to balance our desire for polish with our desire to learn. The only way to truly learn if a product will meet user needs is to give the product to users. So, most software developers today follow a lean approach which advocates for releasing a bare-minium version of the product, learning from users, then iterating based on user feedback. In the least lesson, we discussed the danger of big bang delivery and advocated for small iterative releases. In this lesson, we'll explore how to craft an MVP


## The Skateboard

The drawing above is adapated from a popular blog by Henrik Kniberg where he explains how to think about the concept of an MVP. It addresses one of the most common questions about MVPs -- how to deliver value in an iterative manner. Kniberg argues that you should think about your product development like the image on the bottom, where you MVP is a skateboard, rather than the image on the top. Watch the video below to learn more about why.

We learn a few key lessons about MVPs from the video:
- The MVP is the **earliest testable product**. The main goal at this point is to learn.
- Think big, but deliver in small, functionally valuable increments
- Iterative approach helps us find the simplest way to solve the customer's problem, and often leads to slightly different but better products than originally envisioned


## Ideate: what's your skateboard?

<aside>
ðŸ’¬ Imagine you are designing a peer-to-peer tutoring service for students at a university. You envision a service that will let anyone go to a web app, input what they need help with, and be nearly instantly matched up with someone available to tutor them in real-time. What's the skateboard for the product? What is the smallest thing you can put in the hands of real users to get real feedback?

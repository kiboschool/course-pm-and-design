## What We Learned
- Information architecture (IA) diagrams help designers clearly map out how a product should be organized and structured so that it's easy for users to find what they are looking for and understand how all the pieces of a digital product fit together.
- What to do before creating an IA diagram.
- The steps involved in creating an IA diagram.
- How to test IA diagrams using card sorting and tree testing.
- User flows help to map out the steps a user will take to achieve a specific goal using a product. They also help to identify which areas in a user's journey through a product can be improved. 
- Who is the user?, what is their goal?  and what are the steps they need to take to achieve their goal?, should be defined before creating user flows.

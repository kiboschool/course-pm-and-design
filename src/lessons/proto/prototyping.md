# Prototyping
*Estimated Time: 30 minutes*

---

Prototyping is the process of creating preliminary/scaled down versions of  ideas/products. It provides a low-risk way to test, validate and refine ideas/designs before investing significant resources into building them out. You may recall that prototyping is the fourth stage of the design thinking process. To recap, we start off the design thinking process by understanding users' needs and the problem that needs to be solved _(empathize/research)_. We then define the problem based on information gathered during research _(define)_ after which we generate as many ideas as possible that may solve the problem _(ideate)_. Once we have a good amount of ideas, we create prototypes _(prototype)_ which can be used to test with potential users _(test)_. 

There are many benefits or prototypes one of which has been mentioned above, other benefits are:

- They enable designers to get feedback early from users. By testing prototypes with users, designers can gain valuable insights into how users interact with products and identify areas for improvement.  
- The help to align stakeholders around the design. By creating tangible prototypes that stakeholders can interact with, designers can better communicate their designs and get buy-in from stakeholders.
- They save time and resources in the long run. By identifying and addressing design problems early, designers can avoid costly and time-consuming changes later on.

With the benefits covered let's look at the different types of prototypes which can be used to test, refine and validate ideas/designs.

## Summary and Takeaways

From the video and reading, we learn:

  - The three types of prototypes are; low fidelity, medium fidelity and high fidelity.
  - Fidelity is the level of detail/functionality a prototype has. A good way to think about fidelity is how close to a fully developed product a prototype is.
  - Low fidelity prototypes are best used in the early stages of the design process where a lot of ideas are still up in the air and thereâ€™s still a lot of experimentation going on. They allow us to make changes to ideas/designs easily and quickly. 
  - Examples of low fidelity prototypes are; sketches and paper prototypes.
  - Medium fidelity prototypes are best used during the wireframing stage of the design process. Theyâ€™re great for testing user flows and broad functionalities. 
  - An example of medium fidelity prototypes is clickable wireframes.
  - High fidelity prototypes are best used when you have a good idea of what is going to be built. They're good for fine tuning designs when getting a product ready for launch.
  - An examples of high fidelity prototypes is clickable visual designs/UI mockups

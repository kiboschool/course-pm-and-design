## What We Learned
- Software is a team sport! Software product teams use agile  development to ship small pieces of working functionality, and collaborate well together
- To determine the right metrics to evaluate a product, measure what matters and avoid two common data mistakes:
  - Relying on vanity metrics
  - Being data rich _but_ insight poor
- A great pitch answers three questions as clearly as possible:
  - What are you making?
  - What is the problem?
  - Who is the customer?

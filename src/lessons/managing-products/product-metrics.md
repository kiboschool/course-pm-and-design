Previously, we discussed crafting MVPS and using the "Build, Measure, Learn" (Learn, Build, Measure) framework to iterate towards a userful product. We've also examined agile development, a methodology that helps product teams implement iterative development.  For iterative development to deliver value, teams have to measure and learn. In this lesson, we explore how to use metrics to improve products. 


Measuring the right metrics and drawing useful insights can be challenging. Often, product teams make two mistakes when it comes to metrics

1. They rely on vanity metrics
2. They are data rich _but_ insight poor


## Metrics mistakes

### Vanity metrics

<aside>
  
  ðŸ—£ **"Vanity metrics are metrics that make you look good to others but do not help you understand your performance in a way that informs future strategies. These metrics are exciting to point to if you want to appear to be improving, but they often arenâ€™t actionable and arenâ€™t related to anything you can control or repeat in a meaningful way."** - Tableau 
</aside>


Vanity metrics are metrics that may be impressive on the surface but do not provide meaningful insights into the performance of the software. Some examples are:

- Pageviews: pageviews can be misleading because a website may get a lot of visitors, but it doesn't indicate whether users are actually engaging with the content on the site.

- Downloads: the number of downloads for a mobile app can be a vanity metric if many users download the app but few actually use it.

- Sign-ups: the number of sign-ups for a service can be a vanity metric if many users sign up but few actually become regular users.

- Social media followers: having a large number of social media followers may be impressive, but it doesn't necessarily translate into meaningful engagement or business value.

- Time spent on site: the amount of time users spend on a website can be a vanity metric since it doesn't necessarily indicate whether users are finding what they need or taking desired actions.

These metrics may provide some indication of reach, but what makes them "vanity metrics" is that they don't necessarily tell us if the product is meeting the goals of the user or business. 

### Data rich _but_ insight poor
Being data-rich but insight-poor means that an organization has access to large amounts of data but is not able to extract meaningful insights or take action based on that data. In other words, the organization may be collecting data but is not able to use it effectively to inform decision-making or drive improvements.

### Actionable metrics
The two data challenges above have the same solution:

Software teams can avoid relying on vanity metrics and draw meaningful insight from data by:
1. Tracking metrics that are tied to specific business goals or user needs. These "actionable metrics" help teams understand how the software is performing and how it can be improved.
2. Tracking metrics consistently and accurately. If the data being collected is inaccurate or incomplete, it may be difficult to draw meaningful conclusions or make informed decisions based on that data. So, good teams ensure they collect data well 
3. Analyzing data regularly: Having access to high-quality data is not enough. Organizations will need to have the skills and make the time to analyze that data effectively

## One Metric that Matters
One Metric That Matters (OMTM) is a concept that suggests companies should focus on identifying and tracking a single metric that is most closely tied to their core business objective. In the context of software products, identifying an OMTM can be helpful for focusing on specific business goals or user needs, prioritizing work, measuring the impact of efforts, and making data-driven decisions to drive improvements. By tracking a single metric, product teams can better align their efforts and resources around their core business objective and achieve meaningful improvements in product performance.

here are some examples of software products and their One Metric That Matters (OMTM):

Facebook: Daily Active Users (DAUs). The number of users who log into Facebook on a daily basis is Facebook's OMTM, as it is closely tied to the company's core business objective of increasing engagement and advertising revenue.

Spotify: Time Spent Listening (TSL). The amount of time users spend listening to music on Spotify is the company's OMTM, as it is closely tied to the company's core business objective of increasing user engagement and subscription revenue.

Slack: Daily Active Users (DAUs). The number of users who actively use Slack on a daily basis is the company's OMTM, as it is closely tied to the company's core business objective of increasing workplace productivity and collaboration.

Uber: Completed Rides. The number of completed rides on Uber's platform is the company's OMTM, as it is closely tied to the company's core business objective of increasing revenue and market share.

Airbnb: Nights Booked. The number of nights that users book through Airbnb's platform is the company's OMTM, as it is closely tied to the company's core business objective of increasing revenue and market share.

by customers, as it is closely tied to the company's core business objective of increasing user engagement and subscription revenue through video conferencing software.

Atlassian: Time to Resolution (TTR). Atlassian's OMTM is the time it takes to resolve customer support issues, as it is closely tied to the company's core business objective of providing high-quality software products and services to enterprise customers.

Overall, identifying an OMTM can help companies focus on a single metric that is most closely tied to their core business objective and make data-driven decisions to drive improvements in product performance.

there are some risks associated with focusing too heavily on a single metric as the One Metric That Matters (OMTM). Here are a few potential risks:

Tunnel vision: By focusing too heavily on a single metric, product teams can lose sight of other important metrics or user needs that may be critical to the success of the product.

Unintended consequences: Focusing on a single metric can lead to unintended consequences, such as encouraging users to engage in behavior that is not in their best interest or sacrificing long-term growth for short-term gains.

Incomplete picture: Focusing on a single metric can provide an incomplete picture of the product's overall performance or impact, as other important factors may not be captured by the chosen metric.

To avoid these risks, it is important for product teams to consider the context and broader business objectives when identifying an OMTM. They should also regularly review other metrics and user feedback to ensure that they are not inadvertently sacrificing long-term success for short-term gains. Finally, it's important to keep in mind that the OMTM is a tool for driving improvements in product performance, not an end goal in itself. By staying focused on the broader business objectives and user needs, product teams can avoid the risks of focusing too heavily on a single metric.

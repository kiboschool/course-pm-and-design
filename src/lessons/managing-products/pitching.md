*Estimated Time: 30 minutes*

Throughout this class, you've learned how to build products, with an emphasis on building the right thing. We finish the class with a brief discussion of pitching product ideas. Pitching is a key skill for product managers and designers. You may find yourself pitching to:

- Attracting investors or stakeholders: if you are seeking funding for your product or idea, you need to be able to pitch it effectively to investors. If you are at a company and seeking permission to work on a new product feature or idea, you may need to pitch to executives to convince them to invest

- Convincing customers: You need to be able to articulate the benefits of your product or idea in a clear and compelling way in order to convince potential customers to buy or use it.

- Recruiting team members: If you are building a team to work on your product or idea, you need to be able to pitch it to potential team members in order to convince them to join you.

- Differentiating yourself from competitors: A good pitch can help you stand out from your competitors and position your product or idea as unique and valuable.

For all the reasons above, learning how to create a compelling pitch is critical

### Video Notes
From the video, we learned that a good pitch is clear, concise, and creates a foundation for curiosity. 

A good pitch **answers:**
- What are you making?
- What is the problem?
- Who is the customer?

A good pitch **is:**
- **Legible:** a legible idea can be understood by people who know nothing about your business
- **Problem-focused:** people need to **understand the proble**m you're solving
- **Conversational:** you should be able ot explain to your mom and have her understand it. It includes no jargon

A good pitch **avoids:**
- Ambiguity
- Complexity (don't have multiple braids or trying to mix a lot of things
- Mystery (jargon)
- Ignorable (marketing speak, mba speak, buzzwords)

*Estimated Time: 30 minutes*

---

Throughout this class, you've learned how to build products, with an emphasis on building the right thing. We finish with a brief discussion of pitching product ideas. Pitching is a key skill for product managers and designers. You may find yourself pitching to:

- Attract investors or stakeholders: if you are seeking funding for your product or idea, you need to be able to pitch it effectively to investors. If you are at a company and seeking permission to work on a new product feature or idea, you may need to pitch to executives to allow you to invest time in the project.

- Convince customers: You need to be able to articulate the benefits of your product to convince potential customers to buy or use it.

- Recruiting team members: you need to be able to pitch your idea to convince potential team members to work with you 

- Differentiating yourself from competitors: A good pitch can help you stand out from your competitors and position your product or idea as unique and valuable.

For all the reasons above, learning how to create a compelling pitch is critical

### Video Notes
From the video, we learned that a good pitch is clear, concise, and creates a foundation for curiosity. 

**A good pitch answers:**
- What are you making?
- What is the problem?
- Who is the customer?

**A good pitch is**
- **Legible:** a legible idea can be understood by people who know nothing about your business
- **Problem-focused:** people need to **understand the proble**m you're solving
- **Conversational:** you should be able ot explain to your mom and have her understand it. It includes no jargon

**A good pitch avoids:**
- **Ambiguity:** don't use abstract descriptions. Aim to be so clear that your mom can understand it!
- **Complexity:** don't weave multiple storylines or ideas together in your description
- **Mystery:** remove jargon, suggestions, or anything that typical users won't undersatnd
- **Ignorable language:** avoid language that users will ignore, such as marketing speak, mba speak, jargon and buzzwords

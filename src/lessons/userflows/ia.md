# Information Architecture (IA)
*Estimated Time: 60 minutes*

---

Information architecture (IA) diagrams help designers structure and organize content, features and functionalities in an intuitive and meaningful way that makes it easy for users to access and navigate digital products. 

An IA diagram can be a powerful way to clearly map out how a product should be designed so that it's easy for users to find what they are looking for and understand how all the pieces of a digital product fit together. When done correctly a good IA will lead to:

- A good brand and product image 
- An increase in users 
- Better click through rates 
- Increased conversions and in-turn an increase in revenue

## Creating IA Diagrams

### Video Summary/Takeaways

- Before creating an IA diagram:
  - Define the company goals with the product
  - Define users‚Äô goals with the product 
  - Analyze the IA‚Äôs of similar products to get an idea of what users expect
  - Define your content 
- The steps involved in creating an IA diagram are:
  - Categorize, prioritize, then group content
  - Create a sitemap based on your content groups
  - Outline all the possible ways users can access your content groups (i.e some content groups may be accessed through multiple paths in your product)
  - Create/refine content labels


## Testing IA's

Designers usually create IA‚Äôs based on their assumptions of users' mental models. These assumptions may be influenced by the IA‚Äôs of; competitors‚Äô products, previous products they‚Äôve designed, products they interact with in their daily lives, etc. Oftentimes these assumptions will be correct (for the most part) but there are times when it's trickier to figure out what the most logical/meaningful way to organize and structure content is. When faced with this challenge testing out a proposed information architecture can be a great way to determine if it actually matches users‚Äô mental models. The two most common ways to test IA‚Äôs are by:

- Card sorting
- Tree testing 


### Card Sorting

Card sorting is a great way to discover how users understand and categorize information. It involves asking participants to sort cards containing different items into labeled groups. The results can then be used to figure out how best to group and label information in a way that makes the most sense to users. 



### Tree Testing

Tree testing is a great way to determine how easy it is for users to find what they're looking for in a product. It involves presenting participants with an IA then giving them tasks to accomplish e.g _‚Äúwhere would you look for information about pricing?‚Äù_ or _‚Äúhow would you find answers to questions you may have about this product?‚Äù_. Participants would then be observed to determine how they go about finding the information.


Card sorting and tree testing can be done in different ways, for different reasons and through different mediums but we won't go into those details during this lesson. For now all you need to know is what has been shared above.

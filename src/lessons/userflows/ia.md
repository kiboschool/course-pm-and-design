# Information Architecture (IA)
*Estimated Time: 30 minutes*

## IA diagrams
Information architecture (IA) diagrams help designers structure and organize content and features in an intuitive way that makes it easy for users to access and navigate digital products. 

An IA diagram mpas out how a product should be designed so that it's easy for users to find what they are looking for and understand how all the pieces of the product fit together. When done correctly a good IA will lead to:

- A good brand and product image 
- An increase in users 
- Better click through rates 
- Increased conversions and in-turn an increase in revenue

### Video Summary

Before creating an IA diagram:
  - Define the company goals with the product
  - Define users‚Äô goals with the product 
  - Analyze the IAs of similar products to understand what users expect
  - Define your content 

The steps involved in creating an IA diagram are:
  - Categorize, prioritize, then group content
  - Create a sitemap based on your content groups
  - Outline all the possible ways users can access your content groups (i.e some content groups may be accessed through multiple paths in your product)
  - Create and refine content labels


## Testing IAs

Designers usually create IAs based on their assumptions of users' mental models. These assumptions may be influenced by the IAs of: competitors products, previous products they‚Äôve designed, products they interact with in their daily lives, etc. 

These assumptions are often correct, but there are times when it's trickier to figure out the most logical/meaningful way to organize and structure content. When faced with this challenge, testing out a proposed information architecture is a great way to determine if it  matches users‚Äô mental models. The two most common ways to test IAs are card sorting and tree testing. 


### Card Sorting

Card sorting helps designers discover how users understand and categorize information. It involves asking participants to sort cards containing different items into labeled groups. The results can then be used to figure out how best to group and label information in a way that makes the most sense to users. 



### Tree Testing

Tree testing helps designers determine how easy it is for users to find what they're looking for in a product. It involves presenting participants with an IA then giving them tasks to accomplish e.g _‚Äúwhere would you look for information about pricing?‚Äù_ or _‚Äúhow would you find answers to questions you may have about this product?‚Äù_. Participants are observed to determine how they go about finding the information.


While we won't go into the details in this lesson, note that card sorting and tree testing can be done in different ways, for different reasons and through different mediums.

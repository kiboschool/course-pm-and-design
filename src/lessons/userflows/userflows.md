#  User Flows/User Journeys 
*Estimated Time: 30 minutes*

---

User flows help to map out the steps a user will take to achieve a specific goal (e.g making a purchase, obtaining information, sending a message, etc) using a product. Depending on the product, user flows can either be simple or complex. As a designer, the goal should always be to simplify a users‚Äô journey to achieving a goal using a product.  

User flows are a powerful asset in a designers toolbox because as well as helping to map out the steps to achieve a goal, they also help to identify which areas in a user's journey through a product can be improved. By identifying pain points in the user experience the overall usability of products can be progressively improved.

### Video Summary/Takeaways

- The three key components to a user flow that should be defined before creating users flows are:
  - Who is the user?
  - What is their goal?
  - What are the steps they need to take to achieve their goal?
- User flows help to communicate design from the perspective of the user to engineers, PM‚Äôs and other stakeholders.
- User flows are great for fleshing out all the potential use cases for features in a product. This helps other team members such as engineers plan how they're going to build the product.

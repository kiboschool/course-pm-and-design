## Learning Outcomes

There is no new lesson content for this week. Instead, use this week for review and catch-up. During the live class, you will hear from two guests who studied computing and now work as product managers and designers so that you can:
- Understand how PMs and Designers interact with product teams
- Understand how computer science background impacts professional journeys of PMs & Designers

We will also leave about 30 minutes during live class for questions & answers with Folarin & Ope. Please bring any questions you have about previous lesson materials or assignments.

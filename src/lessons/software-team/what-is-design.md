# What is Product Design?

*Estimated Time: XX hours*

---
A common misconpception about the role of design and designers is that they exist to make software products beautiful. While there is an aesthetic component to design, beauty is a small part of a designer's job. Good design has two intertwined concerns: **form** and **function**. 

Designers ask quesitons like:
- For whom is this product being built? Does it meet a need?
- How will this product be used? What is the user's context?
- Is this product satisfying or delightful to use?

Design is not just about making something that looks. It is about making products that are work well and look good. That's the job of UI and UX Designers.

In building software, it's common to see design roles for UX Designer and UI Designer. What's the difference?

- **UI or User Interface design** is concerned with the _interface_ of the product or the part with which the user interacts. For software products, this is often screens, buttons or other visual and interactive features used in interacting with the product. UI is also increasingly voice interaces and other types of interfaces. UI design is the process of designing how the digital interfaces look and behave, and covers visual and interacitve elements of products such as colors, typography, buttons, scroll functions, andmianos, etc. 
- **UX or user experience design** is concerned with a user's experience with the product, and ensuring that the user interaction with the product is relevant, enjoyable and accessible. A UX designer might focus on
  - Value proposition and ensuring the product solves a real problem for the user
  - User journey, and understanding how the user discovers the prodcut, the touchpoints the user has with the product, and the context of the user's interaction 
  - Onboarding and ensuring the user is able to effectively user the product from their first interaction 
  - User education, and ensuring that explanatory texts, messaging, and support is clear 
  

In some product teams, one individual plays both roles. In large product teams, there many be numerous UX designers and UI designers responsible for different aspects of the product. Another important design function on product teams is **User Research**. User research deals with collecting and analyzing data to improve the product. There may or may not be a dedicated User Researcher. In teams where there is not, the research function is usually shared between Designers and Product Managers.

  What about designing brand assets like logos? Or designing marketing collateral? For most products, brand design and design of materials for product marketing are done outside of the core product team.

## PM and Design collaboration
As previously noted, good software product development is about building the right thing _and_ building the thing right, and it's the PM's job to shepherd the team toward identifying the right thing to build and building it the right way for the business. As we've learned, this is a collaborative task that involves many stakeholders. One of the PM's key collaborators in building the right thing is the designer. 

While it's technically possible that a product manager might define all the product funcitonalty needed, then pass it on to a designer to create interfaces, this is not ideal. Product development is collaborative and iterative. Therefore, effective teams will often see designers and product managers collaborating throughout the product definition process. The duo will work together in various activities including:
- Ideating product features
- Conducting user research and testing
- Analyzing proposed solutions
- Refinining product solutions, creating, testing, and refining prototpyes

# Introduction to Design Thinking

*Estimated Time: XX hours*

In the previous lesson, we said that a product manager‚Äôs job is to collaborate with the team to **build the right thing _and_ build the thing right.** 

But how do PMs and Designers know the right thing to build? Henry Ford, the investor of the mass automobile, allegedly said:
<blockquote>‚ÄúIf I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.‚Äù</blockquote>

Although there‚Äôs no evidence Ford actually said these words, he certainly behaved this way. He was famously tone-deaf to the. 

So, is the way to build great products to ideate then build yoru vision?
NO! 


Building something users want is extremely difficult. Some of the best companies in the world try and get it wrong. Remember Google Glass or‚Ä¶

To build products that are valuable to users, we need to focus on those users and deeply understand their needs, desires, and habits. In this lesson, we‚Äôll learn to apply the principles of design thinking to product development. **Design thinking is an ideology and methodology for creative, human-centric problem-solving. **

The video describes three lenses for bringing an idea into focus:
  1. Feasibility
  2. Desirability
  3. Viability 
  
Design thinking is a solution-based approach to problem-solving that helps to find constructive solutions to effectively tackle a problem.

## Design Thinking Process

### Design Thinking Principles

Before we learn to apply the design thinking process, it's helpful to consider some principles. In their seminal paper "Understanding Innovation: Design Thinking," Christoph Meinel and Harry Leifer of the Hasso-Plattner-Institute of Design at Stanford University (d.school) identified four rules of Design Thinking: 

1. **The human rule:** design is social in nature ‚Äî problems must be solved in a way that satisfies human needs and acknowledge the human elements in all technologies.

2. **The ambiguity rule:** ambiguity is inevitable ‚Äî experiment at the limits of our knowledge, the limits of our ability to control events, and with the freedom to see things in a different light.

3. **The re-design rule:** all design is re-design ‚Äî technology and social circumstances are constantly evolving. We need to understand how our human needs were met in the past. 

4. **The tangibility rule:** making ideas tangible facilitates communication ‚Äî this directly refers to creating prototypes.

Before we dive into the design thinking process, it's importnat to remember that design is not linear.

Though it can be helpful to teach and learn the steps of design thinking, the process is rarely linear in practice. Most of the time, the design process is iterative, and you will combine the phases and adapt them to suit your specific needs. 

### Design Thinking Process

We teach the phases of design thinking as linear steps, but in practice, the process is not always linear‚Äîthe phases combine to form an iterative approach that you can try out and adapt to suit your specific challenge.

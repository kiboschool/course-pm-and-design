  üó£ **To think like a designer requires dreaming up wild ideas, taking time to tinker and test, and being willing to fail early and often. The designer's mindset embraces empathy, optimism, iteration, creativity, and ambiguity. And most critically, design thinking keeps people at the center of every process. A human-centered designer knows that as long as you stay focused on the people you're designing for‚Äîand listen to them directly‚Äîyou can arrive at optimal solutions that meet their needs.** ‚Äî IDEO

In the previous lesson, we said that a product manager‚Äôs job is to collaborate with the team to **build the right thing _and_ build the thing right.** 

But how do PMs and Designers know the right thing to build? Innovating on new products is an inherently creative tasks. Some people argue that creativity and innovation is driven by singularly gifted visionaries (think Steve Jobs) who see into the future and develop defying products. They might agree with Henry Ford, the developer ofthe assembly line and mass automobiles who _allegedly_ said: 

<aside>‚ÄúIf I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.‚Äù</aside>

Intuition and vision have an important role to play in product design. But to build the right thing an innovator must deeply understand the customer's problem. This understanding comes from empirical analysis, observation, and yes, talking to customers. Ford famously stubbornly stuck to his vison for automobiles and as a result lost market share to General Motors and other car companies who spent more time understanding the marketplace and what customers need.


Building impactful products is extremely difficult. Even the best companies in the world often try and fail. Notable examples of technology products that failed to meet their impact include Google Glass,.... 

To build products that make our desired user and business impact, we need to take an approach that is deeply human-centric, i.e., understands thee needs, desires and habits of those for whom we are building. One useful approach to doing this it o apply principles of design thinking. In this lesson, we‚Äôll learn to apply the principles of design thinking to product development. **Design thinking is an ideology and methodology for creative, human-centric problem-solving.**

Design thinking is a solution-based approach to problem-solving that helps to find constructive solutions to effectively tackle a problem. 
 The video describes three lenses for bringing an idea into focus:
  1. Feasibility
  2. Desirability
  3. Viability

## Design Thinking Process

### Design Thinking Principles

Before we learn how to apply  design thinking , it's helpful to consider some of its principles. In their seminal paper "Understanding Innovation: Design Thinking," Christoph Meinel and Harry Leifer of the Hasso-Plattner-Institute of Design at Stanford University (d.school) identified four rules of Design Thinking: 

1. **The human rule:** design is social in nature ‚Äî problems must be solved in a way that satisfies human needs and acknowledge the human elements in all technologies.

2. **The ambiguity rule:** ambiguity is inevitable ‚Äî experiment at the limits of our knowledge, the limits of our ability to control events, and with the freedom to see things in a different light.

3. **The re-design rule:** all design is re-design ‚Äî technology and social circumstances are constantly evolving. We need to understand how our human needs were met in the past. 

4. **The tangibility rule:** making ideas tangible facilitates communication ‚Äî this directly refers to creating prototypes.

From the video, we learned a few key insights:
- Though it can be helpful to teach and learn the steps of design thinking, the process is rarely linear in practice. Most of the time, the design process is iterative, and you will combine the phases and adapt them to suit your specific needs. 
- It's helpful to teach the phases of design thinking as linear steps, but in practice, the process is not always linear ‚Äîthe phases combine to form an iterative approach that you can try out and adapt to suit your specific challenge.



## Why Design Thinking Matters
Design thinking helps us craft impactful products that meet user and business needs. This methodology matters promotes:
- Significantly reduce the time it takes to get a new product to market, which ultimately saves money
- Improves customer retention and loyalty: by building with users, you engage them and increase their ownership and buy-in of the product
- Fosters collaboration: design thinking encourages us to collabroate across comapny silos and with our users
- Increases innovation: by asking us to challenge assumptions, design thinking builds our creative muscles

## Summary 
- Building the right thing requires deep understanding of the customer
- Design Thinking is a creative problem-solving approach that helps us find solutions to user problems
- Design is a continous and overlapping process
- We can embark on a human-centric design by following the steps of the design thinking process: Empathy (understanding users, defining their problems), ideation (generating lots of solutions), and refinement (building prototypes, teting withusers, and combining solutions) 
- The steps are not linear!

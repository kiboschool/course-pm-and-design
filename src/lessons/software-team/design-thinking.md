# Introduction to Design Thinking

*Estimated Time: XX hours*

In the previous lesson, we said that a product manager‚Äôs job is to collaborate with the team to **build the right thing _and_ build the thing right.** 

But how do PMs and Designers know the right thing to build? Henry Ford, the investor of the mass automobile, allegedly said:
<aside>‚ÄúIf I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.‚Äù</aside>

Although there‚Äôs no evidence Ford actually said these words, he certainly behaved this way. He was famously tone-deaf to the. 

So, is the way to build great products to ideate then build yoru vision?
NO! 


Building impactful products is extremely difficult. Even the best companies in the world often try and fail. Notable examples of technology products that failed to meet their impact include Google Glass,.... 

To build products that make our desired user and business impact, we need to take an approach that is deeply human-centric, i.e., understand thee needs, desires and habits of those for whom we are building. One useful tool for doing this is by applying design thinkings. In this lesson, we‚Äôll learn to apply the principles of design thinking to product development. **Design thinking is an ideology and methodology for creative, human-centric problem-solving.**

The video describes three lenses for bringing an idea into focus:
  1. Feasibility
  2. Desirability
  3. Viability 
  
Design thinking is a solution-based approach to problem-solving that helps to find constructive solutions to effectively tackle a problem.

## Design Thinking Process

### Design Thinking Principles

Before we learn to apply the design thinking process, it's helpful to consider some principles. In their seminal paper "Understanding Innovation: Design Thinking," Christoph Meinel and Harry Leifer of the Hasso-Plattner-Institute of Design at Stanford University (d.school) identified four rules of Design Thinking: 

1. **The human rule:** design is social in nature ‚Äî problems must be solved in a way that satisfies human needs and acknowledge the human elements in all technologies.

2. **The ambiguity rule:** ambiguity is inevitable ‚Äî experiment at the limits of our knowledge, the limits of our ability to control events, and with the freedom to see things in a different light.

3. **The re-design rule:** all design is re-design ‚Äî technology and social circumstances are constantly evolving. We need to understand how our human needs were met in the past. 

4. **The tangibility rule:** making ideas tangible facilitates communication ‚Äî this directly refers to creating prototypes.

Before we dive into the design thinking process, it's importnat to remember that design is not linear.

Though it can be helpful to teach and learn the steps of design thinking, the process is rarely linear in practice. Most of the time, the design process is iterative, and you will combine the phases and adapt them to suit your specific needs. 

### Design Thinking Process

We teach the phases of design thinking as linear steps, but in practice, the process is not always linear‚Äîthe phases combine to form an iterative approach that you can try out and adapt to suit your specific challenge.

From the video, we learned a few key insights:


## Why Design Thinking Matters
Design thinking helps us craft impactful products that meet user and business needs. This methodology matters promotes:
- Significantly reduce the time it takes to get a new product to market, which ultimately saves money
- Improves customer retention and loyalty: by building with users, you engage them and increase their ownership and buy-in of the product
- Fosters collaboration: design thinking encourages us to collabroate across comapny silos and with our users
- Increases innovation: by asking us to challenge assumptions, design thinking builds our creative muscles

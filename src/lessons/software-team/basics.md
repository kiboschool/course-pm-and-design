## The Myth of the Lone Coder

Popular culture sometimes presents a certain image for the process of building a digital product: a lone genius, typically a (white) guy in a hoodie, is hunched over a computer with coffee or diet coke. He codes furiously and some time later, dishelved but victorious, emerges with a website or app that changes the world and makes him a billionaire.

#### Summary
Product managers are sometimes called "CEOs of the Product."  They work at the intersection of users, technology, and the business
- Build the right thing, i.e., something users want
- Build it the right way, i.e., use the technology resources you have available
- Build the right business, i.e., maximize your business value and chances of survival 


## Being a great PM

PM is a very intersectional role, it requires a lot of the same skills that CEO does, i.e., undersanding different domains, being able to pinch hit for a lot of things, but not necessarily being the expert.
Influence people -- often this influence is soft
Lead people
Earn people's respect
Collaborate well

Good PMs **fall in love with your customer problem, not your solution**

## Computer Science as preparation for PM
Traditionally, becoming a PM has been a bit of an unknown. Now, big tech companies have rtoational roles for PMs. A lot of people go from studyng CS to become produt managers, either right away or after a few years in engineering or technical roles. Let's hear from a few people who've done that.

## PM and Design collaboration
Good software product development is about building the right thing _and_ building the thing right, and it's the PM's job to shepherd the team toward identifying the right thing to build and building it the right way for the business. As we've learned, this is a collaborative task that involves many stakeholders. One of the PM's key collaborators in building the right thing is the designer. 

Software product designers come in many flavors, but generally focus in one of two areas. In a small team, the same individual will likely play both roles. The roles are:
- UI designer
- UX designer 

Sometimes they're different people, but for now we'll call them design. For the rest of this course, when we use "Designer," know that the designer may be involved in a combination of UX and UI work. 

#### In summary
- PMs and Designers work together to build the right things, using some common framework known as the design process

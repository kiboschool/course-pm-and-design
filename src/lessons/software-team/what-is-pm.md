# What is Product Management?

*Estimated Time: XX hours*

---
Product management is one of the most in-demand roles in technology companies. Yet, is an often misunderstood role. It has a long and complex history, and it varies between companies and may even vary within companies. One common abstraction of the PM role is to describe product amangers as "CEOs of the Product." This is somewhat true because PMs act as leader and connective tissue between various functions like engineering, design, sales, marketing, etc. That said, unlike a CEO, companies usually do not roll up to PMs and there will be many stakeholders with equal or greater decision-making authority than a PM. Nevertheless, PMs must provide clear direction and leadership for their products.

Two useful definitions of the job of a product manager are below:

Product managers operate at the intersection of the user/customer, the technology, and the business. A useful summary of a PM's role - and one we'll use throughout this course, is that the product manager's job is to **build the right thing and build the thing right. **

### Build the right thing and build the thing right

**Building the right thing** means deeply understanding the needs of the user and the market, and translating that understanding into a product that users find useful and valuable. Good PMs fall in love with their customer problem, not their solution. 

**Building the thing right** means harnessing resources appropriately, and aligning various stakeholders to build the product in a way that maximizes user and business value, and increases its chances for survival. Much of the PM role is considering and making tradeoffs that shape the product in a specific direction. 

When people say PMs are CEOs of the product, that's because the intersectional role requires many of the same skills that CEO does, i.e., understanding different domains, the ability to wear numerous hats and do/influence different domains without being an expert, the ability to influence people and collaborate well. 



## Computer Science as preparation for PM
Traditionally, becoming a PM has been a bit of an unknown. Now, big tech companies have rtoational roles for PMs. A lot of people go from studyng CS to become produt managers, either right away or after a few years in engineering or technical roles. Let's hear from a few people who've done that.

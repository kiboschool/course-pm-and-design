# What is Product Management?

*Estimated Time: XX hours*

---

Product management is one of the most in-demand roles in technology companies. Yet, it is an often misunderstood role. Product management has long and complex history, and it varies between companies and may even vary within companies. One common abstraction is to describe PMs as "CEOs of the Product." This is _somewhat_ true because PMs act as the overall lead and connect various functions like engineering, design, sales, marketing, etc. That said, unlike a CEO, companies usually do not roll up to PMs, and there are many stakeholders with equal or greater decision-making authority than a PM. Nevertheless, PMs must provide clear direction and leadership for their products.

Two useful definititons of the role of a PM are below:

From the video, article, and definitions above, it should be clear that a PM's job is to drive **impact**. PMs collaborate with others to figure out what product will drive impact, and to create that product. Product managers operate at the intersection of the user/customer, the technology, and the business. A useful summary of a PM's role - and one we'll use throughout this course, is that the product manager's job is to **build the right thing and build the thing right.**

**Building the right thing** is about discovering and identifying the right product. PMs must deeply understand the needs of the user and the market, and translate that understanding into a valable product. Good PMs fall in love with their customer problem, not their solution. 

**Building the thing right** means using resources appropriately, and aligning various stakeholders to build the product in a way that maximizes user and business value. Much of the PM role is considering and making tradeoffs that shape the product in a specific direction. 

When people say PMs are CEOs of the product, that's because being a PM requires many of the same skills that CEO does, i.e., the ability to align a team, define a clear vision and strategy, execute the strategy, and collaborate well. 



## Computer Science as preparation for PM
In the early to mid 2000s, the path to becoming a product manager was unclear. Today, many big technology companies have rotational roles for PMs coming out of university. While being technical is not a requirement to be a PM everywhere, having a strong background in technology and computer science is a bonus. For years, some large companies like Google only hired PMs who had degrees in computer science. While that is no longer the case, training in CS can be an excellent preparation for an impactful product career.

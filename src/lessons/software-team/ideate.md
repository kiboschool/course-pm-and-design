After crafting a problem statement, the next step in the design thinking process is to ideate. The goal of ideation is to generate many potential ideas that _might_ solve the problem, including some alternative or strange solutions. In a design sprint, the section where the participants generate ideas follows "How Might We" and is refered to as "Can We?"



## The blockers to creative ideation
Coming up with many ideas can be hard. Many of us, especially those with affinity for technical subjects, have been told that we're not the "creative type." This idea that creativity is the domain of a select few or a fixed trait is false. We all have creative potential and, guided with the right mindset and activities, can come up with interesting and useful ideas.

## Ideation techniques
There are numerous activities that can help teams and individuals overcome blockers and generate ideas. Atomic‚Äôs 
  <a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2017/05/18/what-is-design-thinking/" target="_blank">Design Thinking Toolkit</a> has numerous activities that design teams can use, including many activities for the ideation phase. Some particularly useful ones are:

### SCAMPER
The SCAMPER method is a brainstorming technique to come up with new ideas by applying a set of creative thinking strategies to a design problem. Starting with an existing solution, a team can apply the SCAMPER technique by answering the following questions:

**S**ubstitute: What can be changed or replaced in the design?<br>
**C**ombine: How can elements be combined or merged in the design?<br>
**A**dapt: How can the design be adapted from something else?<br>
**M**odify: How can the design be altered or modified in some way?<br>
**P**ut to other uses: How can the design be used in a different way?<br>
**E**liminate: What can be removed from the design?<br>
**R**everse: How can the design be reversed or turned upside down?<br>
**R**earrange: How can the elements of the design be rearranged in a different order?<br>

The SCAMPER method is useful for overcoming creative blocks and for generating a large number of ideas in a short amount of time. It can also be a fun and energizing activity for teams to do together.

### Crazy 8s

Crazy 8s is a design thinking technique that involves quickly sketching out 8 different ideas for a design problem in just 8 minutes. The goal is to generate a large number of ideas in a short amount of time, without worrying about the quality of the ideas. This technique is useful for overcoming creative blocks and coming up with new and innovative solutions to design problems. It can also be a fun and energizing activity for teams to do together.

### 2x3s
The 2x3 activity is a design thinking technique that involves creating 2 different ideas for a design problem and then developing 3 different versions of each idea. This technique is useful for exploring different variations of an idea and for narrowing down a set of potential solutions to a design problem. It can also be a useful way to involve multiple team members in the design process, as each team member can contribute their own ideas and perspectives. The 2x3 activity is a bit more focused/structured than crazy 8s. While crazy 8s are about generating as many ideas as possible, 2x3 is more focused on exploring variations of an idea to narrow down on a potential solution.

In future lessons, you will learn about concept tests and work to create concepts for a product idea. The two brainstorming approaches above, Crazy 8s and 2x3s are useful approaches for collaborative brainstorming and coming up with product concepts.

In the previous lesson, we got an overview of design thinking... In this lesson, we'll learn a methodology for defining problems. 


## Problems, not Ideas

  **Focus on your user's problems, not your solution.**

 Throughout the rest of this course, we'll apply the principles of design thinking to go from an idea to a product. We'll engage in an iterative process of developing empathy, defining 


## Problem Statement

As an innovator, deep empathy means that you focus on the user problem. So the first thing you have to learn how to do is articulate the problem. As you build empathy for your users and learn about their lives, you need to understand the problem you are trying to solve. 

To navigate the often ambigious and iterative design process, design teams must constantly come back to the problem they are trying to solve. Without a well constructed problem statement, it's easy to start building solutions or solutions that try to solvee too many problems (scope creep). A Well-constructed, valid and effective problem statements is vital for staying focused in the design process and essential to design thinking. Problem statement are usually one of the outputs of the "Define" stage of design thinking. 

Reflection: what problem is Kibo School solving? Write a problem statement for Kibo in the padlet below.

A good problem statement has some important elements

#### Centered on the user
Problem statements are generated from research insight about users and their needs

#### Assumption free
Problem statements should not make assumptions about the users nor the optimal solutions

#### Well-scoped
Problem statements need to broad enough so that you have creative freedom and don't narrow down the solution space, but narrow enough that they are practical 

In the next lesson, we'll learn about "How Might We," a framework for drafting good problem statements for design.

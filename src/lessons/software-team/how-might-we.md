  ðŸ—£ **If I had an hour to solve a problem, Iâ€™d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions.** â€” Albert Einstein

In this lesson, we learn a framework for articulating clearly defined problems and launching brainstorms: **How Might We** This method takes insights from users and frames a question to answer a problem. 

## How Might We: turning problems into opportunities for design

### Why create HMWs?
To help launch impactful brainstorms by creating a seed that is broad enough to enable a wide range of solutions 

### How to generate HMWs?
Start with user research. Conduct or review user research and generate a strong point of view or problem statement of the user challenges. Review the user challenge and look for aspects of it that can help complete the sentence, "How might we..." 


### What's the right level of scope?
As explained above, one of the keys to creating a successful HMW statement is ensuring that is neither too narrow to hinder braninstorming nor too broad to foster actionable ideas.

## From HMWs to Concepts
Once we hone in on the HMW statement, the next step is creative brainstorming and ideation. There are many different ways to brainstorm. Whatever method you choose, aim to be expansive and come up with many possible ideas/solutions to the HMW. Once you've brainstormed solutions, it's time to move to the next step of the design thinking process which is prototype.

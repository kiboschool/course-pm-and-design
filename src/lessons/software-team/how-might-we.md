In the previous lesson, we describes the steps (remember they are not necessarily linear!) of design thinking. The first two steps - empathize and design - have to do with understanding the user's problem and defining a clear problem statement. In this lesson, we explore a framework for articulating clearly defined problems and launching brainstorms: **How Might We** This method takes insights from users and frames a question to answer a problem.

### Why create HMWs?
To help launch impactful brainstorms by creating a seed that is broad enough to enable a wide range of solutions 

### How to generate HMWs?
Start with user research. Conduct or review user research and generate a strong point of view or problem statement of the user challenges. Review the user challenge and look for aspects of it that can help complete the sentence, "How might we..." 


### What's the right level of scope?
As explained above, one of the keys to creating a successful HMW statement is ensuring that is neither too narrow to hinder braninstorming nor too broad to foster actionable ideas.

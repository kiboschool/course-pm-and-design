In the previous lesson, we got an overview of design thinking... In this lesson, we'll learn a methodology for defining problems. 


## Problem Statement

As an innovator, deep empathy means that you focus on the user problem. So the first thing you have to learn how to do is articulate the problem. As you build empathy for your users and learn about their lives, you need to understand the problem you are trying to solve. 

To navigate the often ambigious and iterative design process, design teams must constantly come back to the problem they are trying to solve. Without a well constructed problem statement, it's easy to start building solutions or solutions that try to solvee too many problems (scope creep). A Well-constructed, valid and effective problem statements is vital for staying focused in the design process and essential to design thinking. Problem statement are usually one of the outputs of the "Define" stage of design thinking.

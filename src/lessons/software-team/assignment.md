## Brief
Throughout this class, you will work on building a product to solve a user problem. Your final assessment will be a development-ready product including product requirement documentation and UI designs. Most of your assignments will build towards this step by step. In this first assignment, you'll pick a HMW to focus on for the rest of the course, and begin generating "Can We" 

For this project, you will work with your squad members. If your squad has 3 or fewer members, you will be on one team. If your squad has 4 or more members, you will split up into two teams of 2-3 people. 

### Step 1: Choose a HMW question to focus on 
Look through the list of HMW questions below and select on that you will focus on during the class. Note that you also have the option to create your own. If you choose this route, send a message in Discord to [Instructor 1] and [Instructor 2] with your HMW statement to obtain approval. 

How Might We
- Help  people learn and practice their native language?
- African artisans reach and sell merchandise to global audiences?
- Help secondary school students discover and learn about potential career paths.
- Help young (and young at hear) people learn and practice the latest dance moves?
- Help busy university students live healthier lives 
- Widlcard: come up with your own HMW statement to work on.


### Step 2: Brainstorm some ideas
Brainstorm potential solutions for your chosen HMW. Your solution should start with "Can We"
You should brainstorm a minimum of 40 ideas, including at least 10 "bad ideas"



## Hints and Guidance

Throughout this class, you will work on building a product to solve a user problem. Your final assessment includes development-ready specs (product requirement document, UI designs and prototypes) for the product. Most of your assignments will build towards this step by step. In this first assignment, you'll pick a "How Might We" problem statement to focus on for the rest of the course, then begin generating ideas in the form of "Can We."

For this project, you will work with your squad members. If your squad has 3 or fewer members, you will be on one team. If your squad has 4 or more members, you will split up into two teams. **Each project team must have 2 or 3 people.**  

## Part 1: Ideate solutions to a HMW problem statement

### Choose a HMW question to focus on 
Look through the list of HMW questions below and select one that you will focus on during the class. If there is another problem/idea you are keen to develop a product form, message your instructors in Discord (via private message) with a custom "Wildcard" HMW problem statement to obtain approval. 

#### How Might We
- Help  people learn and practice their native language
- Help African artisans reach and sell merchandise to global audiences
- Help secondary school students discover and learn about potential career paths
- Help young (and young at hear) people learn and practice the latest dance moves
- Help religious communities engage their members digitally 
- Help busy university students live healthier lives 
- Wildcard: come up with your own HMW statement to work on


### Brainstorm ideas, i.e., "Can We"
Brainstorm potential solutions for your chosen HMW. Your solution should start with "Can We"
You should brainstorm a minimum of 30 ideas, including at least 10 "bad ideas"

## Part 2: Create concepts for testing
- Start by revisiting the solutions ("Can we") that you brainstormed to your HMW concept. Group similar ideas together to create product "concepts" then create a slide for each concept. You should have 4-6 product concept slides. Each concept slide should include:
- A written headline that describes the category of idea
- Optionally, a written subtitle with more information
- 2 - 4 feature ideas, represented by both an image and some text 

For examples of product concepts, take a look at:
- [Bookworm](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CaFZErNJJdSBo8OQ2soClA7eNRiv4fnErAyUyd80fUw/edit), testing concepts for a collaborative reading tool
- The intro to concept testing video, and the slides for the HMW: "How might we empower individuals to take more control of their careers, and experience more meaning at work?"


## Hints and Guidance
- Feel free to brainstorm on paper/pencil then add your ideas to the document later
- If you can, try to find synchronous time for your brainstorm. If you dont have time you can brainstorm asynchronously in Discord. 

## Submission
- Update the permission on your concept slide deck so that anyone at Kibo School with the link can comment
- Submit a link to the slide deck in Gradescope
- Download and submit a PDF copy of your concept deck in Woolf

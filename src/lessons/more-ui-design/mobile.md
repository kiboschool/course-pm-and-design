# Design for Mobile (Android & iOS)
*Estimated Time: XX hours*

---

In this lesson we’ll cover all things to do with UI design for mobile devices. As you may already know Android and iOS are the primary operating systems (OS) used on most mobile devices in the world today - Android owned by Google and iOS owned by Apple. As such, they both publish and regularly update guidelines that help designers and developers build software for their platforms. Android's guidelines are called “Material Design Guidelines” while iOS’ guidelines are called “Human Interface Guidelines”. We’ll kick things off by exploring Android’s Material Design Guidelines. 


## Designing for Android - Material Design

As mentioned above Material Design is a set of guidelines published and regularly updated by Google. These guidelines aim to help designers and developers build usable and beautiful products on Android devices using best practices. The best way to understand these guidelines is to jump in and explore these guidelines yourself. Before doing this though, here are a few good-to-knows about material design.

- Spaces and sizes are always a factor of 8px. So spaces and sizes of components can be 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px and so on.
- Visual cues such as shadows and background fills are used to show elevation - elevation is the distance between two components.  
- Components must have a minimum tap target size of 48px x 48px. This means that any component a human is expected to interact with (touch, swipe, etc) must be no smaller than 48px x 48px.
- Material design has its own set of recommended icons.
- Navigation is usually done through tabs at the top of the screen.

These points are covered extensively on the material design guidelines website. The content on the website can be a lot to take in though so these points have been highlighted as guidelines you can fall back to if you can't remember them all. Please go through the three links below to understand how to design products that meet Google’s material design guidelines. While viewing the links you’ll notice that there are other aspects of material design that are not linked in this lesson - such as “Foundations'' and “Develop”. Feel free to go through these during your free time but you’re not required to go through them for this lesson. Like was mentioned previously, there's a lot of content on the material design guidelines website, not all of it is relevant to design though.

## Designing for iOS - Human Interface Guidelines

Human interface guidelines are guidelines published and regularly updated by Apple. The guidelines aim to help designers and developers build usable and beautiful products on Apple devices using best practices. Apple’s guidelines have less constraints than Google’s rather it asks designers to focuses on the four points below when designing for iOS;

- Help people focus on primary tasks and content by limiting the number of onscreen controls while making secondary details and actions discoverable with minimal interaction.
- Adapt seamlessly to appearance changes — like device orientation, Dark Mode, and Dynamic Type — letting people choose the configurations that work best for them.
- Enable interactions that support the way people usually hold their device. For example, it tends to be easier and more comfortable for people to reach a control when it’s located in the middle or bottom area of the display, so it’s especially important to let people swipe to navigate back or initiate actions in a list row.
- With people’s permission, integrate information available through platform capabilities in ways that enhance the experience without asking people to enter data. For example, you might accept payments, provide security through biometric authentication, or offer features that use the device’s location.

There are no specific icons or size/spacing factors so designers have to come up with these themselves. Personally, I use spacing factors of 6px when designing for iOS, some designers use 5px. Components in iOS are expected to have a minimum tap target size of 44px X 44px. 
Just like with material design the best way to familiarize yourself with human interface guidelines is to jump in and explore them yourself. A link to the guidelines is below. You’ll notice that there are also links to guidelines for iPadOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS. Feel free to go through these during your free time but you’re not required to go through them for this lesson.

These are pretty much all you need to know about designing for Android and iOS. Everything else you need to learn can only come from continuously designing UI’s. It’s important to note that these are just guidelines. You’ll often see products on both platforms that go against some of these guidelines. This doesn’t mean these products are designed poorly, rather, it may be a case where the designers have become familiar enough with the guidelines that they know how and where they can make customizations. It's also important to note that not all products have different versions of their applications for Android and iOS. Some products have one design which is built and deployed on both Android and iOS. This is done for many reasons such as; cost, time, limited human resources, etc so it’s definitely not wrong to do so. 


To wrap things up in this lesson, it can be helpful to see what the key differences between Material Design and Human Interface Design are. These differences are highlighted in the article below. Please take some time to go through it.

## Reflect
We’ve covered quite a bit of content on designing for mobile. Before moving on to the next lesson, spend a few minutes reflecting on material design and human interface guidelines and, what the differences between them are. What are the most important things to remember when designing for both platforms? What rules do you need to adhere to and which ones can be broken?

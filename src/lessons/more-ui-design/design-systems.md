# Introduction to Design Systems
*Estimated Time: XX hours*

---

Design systems are a regularly updated library of reusable components (buttons, typescales, forms, inputs, etc) standards, guidelines, interactions, etc that help effectively and efficiently design and build usable and aesthetically pleasing products. Design systems vary from company to company. The maturity of a design system correlates directly to the maturity of a company and the importance it places on design. This is to say that in your early days as a designer you may not work with mature design systems, you may not even work with design systems at all. Many experienced designers have their own personal design systems that they’ve developed as they’ve progressed in their careers but its taken them several years and designs to build up a design system that’s versatile, flexible and effective enough for the different designs they work on. This is because it takes a lot of time, resources and design chops to build a good design system. Based on this, the goal of this lesson is not to teach you how to create design systems but to explain; what design systems are, how they’re useful and what you can expect when/if you work with design systems in the future. The article below is a comprehensive guide to design systems and will explain everything you need to know about design systems at this stage. Please make sure you go through it and watch the videos linked in the article.

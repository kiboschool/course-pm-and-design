# Design for Web
*Estimated Time: XX hours*

---

In this lesson we’ll cover all things to do with UI design for websites. Designing for web is slightly more difficult that designing for mobile, mainly because there’s more screen real estate and less interactions to work with. Users can click, swipe, long press, pinch, zoom, etc when interacting with mobile interfaces while on the web, users can click, drag, long press and double click. There are also no specific guidelines, space/size factors or icons when designing for the web. Based on this, a few good-to-knows when designing for web have been highlighted below;

- Feel free to use icons, images and illustrations from anywhere as long as the styles match and create balance in your design. 
- Use any size/spacing factor that you’re comfortable with as long as it's reasonable. I use either 6px or 8px since that's what I use for mobile (keeps things simple). 
- Click targets should be no smaller 24px x 24px.

Other than these and the basic principles of UI design covered in chapter 3, there aren’t many other considerations you need to make when designing for the web. We’ll cover anything else you need to know during the user experience (UX) part of this course, you’ll also pick up more useful tips and guides as you spend more time designing. 


## Responsive Web Design
As of August 2022, about 54% of global website traffic was on mobile devices while about 46% was on desktop. This tells us that websites were accessed more on mobile devices than on desktops. This is the result of a trend that has been growing over the last decade where more people are able to gain access to the web using mobile devices since they are cheaper than desktops. So what does this mean for web design?  

It means designers have to create responsive web designs. Responsive web designs are designs that change and adapt based on the devices/screen sizes used to access them. You may have noticed this yourself but just in case you haven't, visit www.medium.com on your desktop, then visit it on your mobile phone, the differences are clear but the content is pretty much the same. So how do we create responsive web designs? We’ll cover that in the sub-sections below.  


### Layout Grid
Layout grids allow designers to create layouts that change dynamically based on the device/screen size used to access a website. In theory this means that based on the layout of a design at one screen size, it's relatively easy to predict how the layout will change at other screen sizes. This leads many early stage designers to believe that if they create their design on one screen size, it can be adapted later in development to respond to multiple screen sizes, unfortunately this is not the case. Best practice is for designers to layout their designs at multiple screen sizes (often called breakpoints). These breakpoints act as guides for the development team which tells them what range of screen sizes a particular layout should hold before changing to a different layout. More details on breakpoints will be shared in the sub-section below. Layout grids consist of columns, gutters and margins, they are also useful for aligning and separating content in UI design. Please watch the video below to learn what columns, gutters and margins are and how to create a layout grid in Figma.

### Designing for Different Breakpoints
As mentioned above best practice when designing for web is for designers to layout their designs at multiple breakpoints (screen sizes). Depending on the team you’re working with you may need to layout your designs on anywhere from 3 - 5 different breakpoints. In cases where you're the only designer working on a product, 2 breakpoints should be acceptable (as long as your team is onboard with this). So what sizes should your break points be?

Depending on if you’re laying out your designs on 5 or 3 breakpoints, your largest screen width (frame size in figma) could be either 1920px or 1440px respectively - personally, I use 1440px as my largest breakpoint. The smallest breakpoint is usually 360px. You’ll often hear/read that a mobile-first approach should be used when designing for web. This means that when designing for web, designs for the smallest mobile breakpoint (360px) should be done first before designing for the largest (1440px or 1920px). This is due to the stats shared above about global website traffic on mobile devices vs desktops. Personally I do the opposite, I design for the largest breakpoint (1440px) then work backwards to mobile. This is mainly because I find designing for mobile easier than web and from my experience I’ve found that many designers do the same. There's no right or wrong way as long as all breakpoints agreed upon by your team are designed, whichever one you start with should be fine. Some other breakpoints you may come across are 1280px, 1024px, 720px, 600px, etc. 

As you layout your designs at different breakpoints the layout grid you use will need to change to match the breakpoint you’re designing for. Please watch the video below for how to layout your designs at different breakpoints and how to create layout grids for different breakpoints.

## Sign up for Figma and practice FigJam
Figma is a collaborative design tool and one the most widely-used professioanl design tools today. During this class, you will use Figma to create wireframes, high-fidelity designs and prototpes. You will also use FigJam, an online whiteboarding and collaborative tool that is part of Figma. We'll use FigJam in class. You can also use it with your teammates for live or async brainstorm. 

To prepare for the next class, you need to sign up for Figma and practice using FigJam. **Important: please watch the video below _before_ signing up as it is important you follow the sign up steps for an education license.**

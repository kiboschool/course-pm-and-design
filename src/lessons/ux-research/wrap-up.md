## What We Learned

- UX research enables product teams to gather data from and about users, and to identify opportunities for impact
- Concept testing is a research method to get user feedback on potential solutions early in the design process
- UX research principles
  - When conducting research, use a mix of both quantitative and qualitiative research, as well as a mix of attitudinal and behavioral approaches. This enables you to get the clearest and most naunced view of a design problem.
  - The right research technique to deploy will depend on your specific product's lifecycle and the resources you have available. One important principle is key though: don't skip research!

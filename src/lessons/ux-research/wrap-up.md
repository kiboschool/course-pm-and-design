  - When conducting research, use a mix of both quantitative and qualitiative research, as well as a mix of attitudinal and behavioral approaches. This enables you to get the clearest and most naunced view of a design problem.
  - Knowing which research techniques to deploy and when will depend on your specific product's lifecycle and the resources you have available. One important principle is key though: don't skip research!

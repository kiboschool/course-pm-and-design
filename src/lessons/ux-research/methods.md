In the previous lesson, we learned about broad approaches to UX research. In this lesson, we'll focus on _techniques_ for UX research, determining which to use and when. The aim of this lesson is to provide a broad introduction to different user research techniques. In future lessons and your final project, you'll have the opportunity to put some of these techniques into practice.

The video included a lot of information, and may have mentioned many research techniques you're unfamliar with -- not to worry! The aim of this lesson is not to learn every single research technique but to help you understand that there is a broad array of research techniques available. A professional UX researcher learns them over time to build a UX research toolkit. 

An important insight from the video is that **different techniques work for different parts of product development**. The video breaks up product development into four stages below
- Discovery
- Explore
- Test
- Listen

The stages above map well to the design thinking process which we've been using. In design thinking methodology, they are roughly:
- Discovery ü§ùüèΩ Empthasize
- Explore ü§ùüèΩ Define / Idea
- Test ü§ùüèΩ Prototype / Test
- Listen: this can be linked to multiple part of the design thinking process

## Common UX Research Techniques
As stated above, numerous UX research techniques exists. Below are some common types of which you should be aware. 
- User interviews: one-on-one conversation with a user to understand the user's experience and opinions. User interviews may be highly structured where the researcher asks specific set of questions, or a more unstructured conversation. They can be conducted in-person or via phone or video chat 
-  Field studies: these research studies take place in the user's context. In field studies, the researcher directly observes user behavior. In Ope's work at Google Classroom, she often conducted field studies by standing in the back of real-life classrooms for hours, and watching as teachers and students interacted
-  Diary study: a method of collecting qualitiative data about a user's interaction and behavior over a long period of time. In diary studies, users typically self-report their data. For Google Classroom, we conducted a 1-week diary study with university students where we asked them to record short video reflections throughout the day for a week to better understand their lives day-to-day. Participants are keeping a "diary," or daily log over time. 
- Focus groups: a discussion of typically 5-9 users moderated by a researcher
- Surveys: a series of questions posted to many users. In Google Classroom, we used a survey method called "HaTs" which asked about 2,000 users each week in the product to answer the same 10 questions. Over the years, we built a robust, statisically meaningful understanding of the product 
- Concept testing: a product discovery test where you introduce a product concept to the target audience to determine if it's worth following through on an idea. This could be done for an entire application, a revamped website design, new branding, etc. 
- Usability testing: a product test where representative users interact with a product prototype. During this test, a moderator usually asks partcipants to perform certain tasks, then observes the participants' behavior and feedback
- A/B testing: sometimes referred to as split testing, A/B testing is a randomized testing process where two or more versions of a product are shown to users to determine which performs better

Again, the above is not a comprehensive list of UX research techniques, but a list of some of the more common ones. 


## UX Research and User-Centered Design
Recall that the product development life-cycle typically covers numerous phases. UX Research has a role to play in all of them. Depending on the stage of product development, you can employ different UX research techniques

### Emphathize
This stage is almost entirely research dependent. Qualitative research methods can be helpful as you better understand your users. A good method to use here is user interviews. Good research techniques here include:
- User interviews 
User interviews:: 

### Define
In this phase, you are defining or stating the problem. Good research techniques here might include:
- User interviews to better understand the user context 

### Ideate
In this phase, you are generating many potential ideas that might solve the problem, and looking for altenrative or idiosyncratic solutions. Research techniques that help here might include:
- Focus groups with groups of users to co-create and ideate 
- Concept testing to get user feedback on high-level direction

### Prototype

### Test
In this stage, you rigorously test prototypes and use the results to refine your problem statement and/or solutions. Research techniques that may be particularly useful here include:
- Usability testing 
- A/B testing

## UX Research Principle 2: Don't Skip Research
üí° Knowing which research techniques to deploy and when will depend on your specific product's lifecycle and the resources you have available. One important principle is key though: don't skip research! 



ToDo: add a typeform asking students to pick a different test technique and suggest answers

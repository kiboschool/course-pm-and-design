## Benefits of concept testing
- Deepen understanding: engage users to better understand the problem
- Reduce risks: test ideas early and save time before full design 
- Discover new insights and opportunities

## When to run a concept test
Concept tests are useful in the discovery stage of product development, when you are trying to figure out which ideas are worth moving forward with. The slides format shown in the video is not the only way to do a concept test, but it's the one we'll use in this class. 

## How to run a concept test
The steps to running a concept test are the same as the ones outlined in the previous lesson on conducting user reseach:

1. Determine your goals 
2. Recruit participants 
3. Create an interview guide. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15Yrog_oAWJWPjYYlOXfOp8AzBl11bWHeihO5_b00TkE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> This </a> is a template for interviewing. 
4. Conduct the test
5. Analyze and summarize your results

This lesson explores why you need a UX research strategy, and walks you through the main steps of conducing research. 


## How to craft a UX research strategy
Conducting useful research requires a plan. A UX research strategy is a guiding plan for research that outlines the why, when, and how of your research. A well-crafted strategy can help ensure that the research you conduct will actually help build a meaningful product. 

A  strategy should outline:
- Why the research is necessary, and the expected value to your team. Crafting a compelling reason for research helps to gain buy-in among stakeholders 
- The individual research projects and techniques that will be used 
- A research timeline and plan
- A plan to disseminate and share research results, and ensure they are used

### Step 1: who is your research for?
All UX research should ultimately be for the benefit of the user. That said, depending on the research, there are likely stakeholders within the team or business who will use the research. This might be a business leader who will use it to determine if a product direction is worth pursuing, a product manager who will use it to determine which features should be discarded or included, or an engineer who will use it to determine where to invest in technical improvements. The first step in a well-crafted research strategy is to clearly articulate the primary stakeholder(s) for the output.

### Step 2: what are you researching?
Just as there might be various stakeholders who will use the research, the _what_ of the research might vary as well. You might be researching a feature idea, or an existing product feature. Determining what you are researching and the key questions you want answers to are critical steps in the strategy. 

### Step 3: Gather the team 
Once you know for who and what, the next step is with who. Determine who will part of conducting the research. Depending on the team size, this might include dedicated UX researchers, UX designers, product managers, engineers, and more. 

### Step 4: Create a research plan
A research plan puts down on paper the entire process of research. It will include the following sections:
- Define the problem statement
- Identify your objectives
- Choose the right research method
- Establish the research timeline
- Recruit participants
- Prepare the research materials (brief, prototypes)
- Define how youâ€™ll present your findings

## Conducting user interviews 
For the rest of this class, most of the research we'll conduct will be in the form of user interviews. We will conduct two types of user interviews
- Concept tests to test early feature ideas
- Usability tests to test UI functionality

 As the video explains, when conducting user interviews, you should:
 - Have a friendly welcome that explains the point of the interview
 - Have context questions, that help you get background information from the user 
 - Introduce the prototype, and ensure the user feels comfortable giving feedback and doesn't feel like they're being tested
 - Give customers some tasks, and pay attention to their feedback 
 - Debrief with the user, and try to get overall summary of the interview

_Note: the video above works well when conducting a usability test. The general steps are the same for a concept test, but will vary as we won't be testing a specific app_

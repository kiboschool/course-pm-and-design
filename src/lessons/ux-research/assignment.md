## Brief
You'll continue working on your project by creating concepts for testing. 

For this project, you will work with your squad members. If your squad has 3 or fewer members, you will be on one team. If your squad has 4 or more members, you will split up into two teams of 2-3 people. 

### Step 1: Organize your "Can Wes" into groups
Look through the ideas you came up with in the previous assignment. Organize your ideas into related groups

### Step 2: Create concepts for testing
- Review [Introduction to Concept Testing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HupFgAqn4vdnvWIXo3l1WO4BhNeKDB5SAlECkZExcxY/edit)
- Create a Google Slide deck for your concept. Each concept slide should describe one value proposition. Each value prop should have 3-4 "concepts" illustrated with an image and some text
- Start by revisiting the solutions ("Can we") that you brainstormed to your HMW concept. Group similar ideas together to create product "concepts" then create a slide for each concept. You should have 4-6 product concept slides. Each concept slide should include:
- A written headline that describes the category of idea
- Optionally, a written subtitle with more information
- 2 - 4 feature ideas, represented by both an image and some text 

For examples of product concepts, take a look at:
- [Bookworm](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CaFZErNJJdSBo8OQ2soClA7eNRiv4fnErAyUyd80fUw/edit), testing concepts for a collaborative reading tool
- The intro to concept testing video, and the slides for the HMW: "How might we empower individuals to take more control of their careers, and experience more meaning at work?"

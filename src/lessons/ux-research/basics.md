## What is User Experience (UX) Research?
User experience research is a critical part of the design process. 

UX research is the process of studying the behaviors, needs, attitudes and motivations of users in order to improve the design of software, services or products. UX researchers conduct various types of research, including interviews, surveys, usability tests in order to gather data from users and identifies opportunites for impact. 


  

## Quantitative vs. qualitative research
Two main types of UX research methods are quantitative and qualitative. 


### Quantitative research 
Quantiative UX research focuses on collecting and analyzing numerical data. This can include surveys, polls, usage logs, or other methods of data collection that provide numerical data which can be analyszed using statistical techniques. Quantitative research is useful to gnerate a large amount of data from a large sample size, and to make generalizations about a user group or population. This type of research is often used to test hypotheses and identify trends or patterns in user behavior. Some types of questions a UX researcher might answers with quantiative research includes:
- How many active users does the product have each day or each month?
- What share of people find the call to action on the page?
- What is the average satisfaction level of users with the product or service?

### Qualitative research

Qualitative UX research focuses on understanding user experiences and behaviors in a more in-depth and nuanced way. This type of research typically involves conducting interviews, focus groups, observations, or other forms of data collection that allow researchers to probe users' thoughts, feelings, and experiences in greater detail. Qualitative research often involves smaller sample sizes and is used to generate rich, detailed insights into user behavior and preferences.

Qualitative ux research differs from quantitative research in that it is less focused on collecting and analyzing numerical data. Instead, it focuses on understanding the underlying reasons behind user behavior and preferences, and on exploring the subjective experiences of users. This type of research is often used to identify trends or patterns that may not be immediately apparent from numerical data, and to gain a deeper understanding of user motivations and behaviors.

## Attitudinal vs. behaviorial research

Another set of research methods is attitudinal vs. behaviorial. The difference in these two approaches draws from the insight that what people say and believe, i.e., their attitudes, are often different from what they actually do, i.e., their behavior. In order to build impactful products, it's importnat to understand both what your users belief and hwo they behave. 



### Attitudinal research 
Attitudinal research focuses on understanding the attitudes and beliefs of a user. It typically involves conducting surveys, interviews, or other forms of data collection that allow researchers to explore people's attitudes and beliefs in greater detail. This type of research is often used to identify potential problems or issues with a product or service, to gauge the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, or to understand the underlying reasons behind people's attitudes and beliefs.

### Behaviorial research

Behavioral research focuses on understanding the actions and behaviors of users in relation to a particular product or service. It typically includes studies of how users interact with the product or service, how they navigate through different features or pages, or how they respond to different design elements. Behavioral research might involve tracking their actions and behaviors through the use of tools like heat maps or click tracking software. This type of research is often used to identify areas for improvement in a product or service, to understand user behavior and preferences, or to inform the design of future products or services.

## UX Design principle 1: Mix it up!
ðŸ’¡ When conducting research, use a mix of both quantitative and qualitiative research, as well as a mix of attitudinal and behavior approaches. This enables you to get the clearest and most naunced view of a deisgn problems.

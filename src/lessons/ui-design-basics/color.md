## Introduction

Color is a major aspect of UI design. It has the ability to heavily influence how people view; your design, physical and digital products and brands in general. Even in our everyday lives, color is used to give signals and feedback in places where text and images are not convenient as a means of communication. It’s generally understood around the world that at a traffic light, red means stop, yellow means get ready and green means go. This is an example of how color can be used to provide certain signals without the use of words or images. In this chapter you’ll learn how different colors affect people physically and emotionally, how the meaning behind colors can change depending on culture/region and how to effectively use color in UI design. To kick things off, let’s dive into how different colors affect us psychologically, physically and emotionally.

## Color Psychology

As mentioned above, different colors convey different emotions. Based on this, it's important to understand what positive and negative emotions/feelings can be associated with the colors you may use in your designs. 

### Red

Red has the longest wavelength meaning it's the first color to catch your attention amongst other colors. Looking at the color red increases our heart rate and activates our fight or flight response which makes us more alert and anxious. 

Due to these properties, red is often used to convey; courage, strength, warmth, love, energy, masculinity, etc. Be careful when using red though because it can also convey aggression, extreme caution, stress and a few other negative feelings. 

Brands that use red are often trying to communicate a sense of strength, passion, excitement, professionalism, etc. Due to the nature of the color though, they're careful not to overuse it in their branding. 

Examples of brands that use red are; Coca-Cola, CNN, Youtube, Bank of America, Virgin, Red Cross, Netflix, Marvel, etc.

### Pink

Pink is a tint of red therefore it affects us in a similar way. The major difference between the two is that while red stimulates us, pink soothes us. A great example of this is Valentine's Day. As we approach Valentine's Day, it’s very common to see images and illustrations with red and pink themes. This raises our heart rates and soothes us simultaneously, making us anxious for passionate and comforting expressions of love. As you can imagine, many brands leverage our heightened senses during this period to encourage us to buy things to express love to our loved ones.  

Pink is great for conveying; nurture, warmth, femininity, love, sexuality and passion. On the other hand it can also be used to convey; physical weakness, claustrophobia, shyness, discomfort, etc. 

Examples of brands that use pink are; Airbnb, Lyft, Victoria's Secret, Tinder, T-Mobile, etc.

### Blue

Blue is a soothing color, unlike red it affects us mentally rather than physically. Looking at blue calms people down and gives off a feeling of trust, clarity and intelligence. Due to these properties, It’s probably the most common color used by brands. 

Blue is great for conveying; trust, intelligence, calmness, security, logic, serenity, efficiency, etc. On the other hand it can also show; lack of emotion, coldness, unfriendliness, etc. 

Examples of brands that use blue are; Meta, Twitter, LinkedIn, Chase Bank, PayPal, IBM, Samsung, Gap, etc.

### Green

Green is a color of balance. It’s right in the middle of the visible light spectrum meaning our eyes are very comfortable looking at it. This nature of green makes it give off a feeling of peace and rest as well. Think about the trees, plants, vegetation you see around you. On a primal level, these are reassuring signs of life, food and health. 

Green is great at conveying; harmony, balance, environmental awareness, education, growth, rest, peace, health, etc. On the other hand it can also come off as boring, fatigued, bland, slow, tired, etc.

Examples of brands that use green are; Starbucks Coffee, Spotify, Animal Planet, Android, Khan Academy, Duolingo, WhatsApp, Hulu, Heineken, etc. 

### Brown

Brown is a serious color and represents support, reliability and nature. Think about tree trunks, wood and earth (soil). These are all things that we rely on and trust to carry weight and nurture us. Tree trunks and branches hold leaves and fruits that provide us food. Wood is used for furniture and is the primary building material for homes in some parts of the world. We plant seeds in the earth (soil) and trust it to provide a good environment for our seed to grow into food and flowers. The earth (soil) is also home to many animals, bacteria and microorganisms that are essential in keeping our ecosystem healthy. 

Brown is great at conveying; seriousness, nature, reliability, support, nature, etc. On the other hand it can also come off as heavy, clunky, dry, boring and unsophisticated. 

Examples of brand that use brown are; UPS, Louis Vuiton, M&M, Nespresso, etc 

### Orange

Orange is a stimulating color and brings about both physical and emotional reactions. It's generally seen as a fun color and represents playfulness, warmth and boldness. Think of our sun and the many other stars that are orange when seen in space. Many planets depend on them for warmth. They represent a source of heat which is necessary for life and the gravitational pull of these stars also keep their planets in place. 

Orange is great at conveying; passion, abundance, fun, security, warmth, physical comfort, sensuality, food, etc. On the other hand it can also show; deprivation, immaturity, silliness, etc.

Examples of brands that use orange are; Nickelodeon, Soundcloud, Mastercard, Amazon, Rockstar Entertainment, Headspace, Harley Davidson, etc.

### Yellow

Yellow has a relatively long wavelength which makes it a stimulating color as well. Unlike red it’s emotionally stimulating rather than physically, this makes it the strongest color psychologically. Looking at yellow lifts our spirits and makes us confident and optimistic. Think about how every morning we rise to the view of our bright yellow sun. It kicks us into action and as the sun gradually fades so does our energy throughout the day. 

Yellow is great at conveying; confidence, optimism, emotional strength, friendliness, creativity, self-esteem, etc. On the other hand because of its strong connection to our psychology it can also represent; depression, fear, anxiety, emotional fragility, suicide, etc. 

Examples of brands that use yellow are; Snapchat, McDonalds, Bumble, Nikon, Ikea, Walmart, Ferrari, etc

### Violet (Purple)

Violet is the shortest wavelength and elevates our awareness. It's an introvertive color and encourages deep thought and meditation. It can also represent royalty and the finer thing of life. Roman emperors starting with Julius Caesar wore purple garments to show their royal status. Purple is also the last color in the visible light spectrum so it can also be used to represent space and the cosmos. 

Purple is great at conveying; spiritual awareness, luxury, truth, quality, vision, authenticity, etc. On the other hand it can also represent introversion, suppression, inferiority, cheapness, etc.

Examples of brands that use purple are; Yahoo, Roku, Taco Bell, Syfy, Twitch, Cadbury, Hallmark, etc.

### Gray

Gray is the only color that has no direct psychological properties or physical properties. It is a suppressive and can often be seen as a depressing color. Think about terms like “the world turning gray” or “gray skies on a rainy day”. In UI design we often see gray used for disabled buttons, inactive elements or placeholder text. 

Gray is great at conveying psychological neutrality. It can also convey; lack of confidence, lack of energy, depression, dampness, etc.

It’s rare to see brands use gray as one of their primary colors but some do use it to show simplicity and luxury. Examples of these brands are; Apple, Nestle, Wii, Toyota, Mercedes, etc.

### Black

Black is a combination of all colors as it absorbs all light. Psychologically this can represent barriers, strength and boldness. In some tones black can be an overwhelming and menacing color. Think about monstrous objects like black holes. They are completely black because they absorb all light and have ridiculous masses. Think also about the dark/night, many people fear it because of the eerie feeling it gives off. 

Black is great at conveying; sophistication, security, glamor, safety, substance, etc. On the other hand it can also come off as oppressive, cold, heavy, menacing, etc. 

Examples of brands that use black are; Apple, SpaceX, Nike, Adidas, Sony, Mont Blanc, Uber, TikTok, BBC, etc.

### White

Just as black absorbs all light, white reflects all light. Like black, it can represent barriers but not in the same way. While black can represent barriers because of its boldness, white can represent barriers because of its purity. Think about brides and religious leaders who wear white to show purity. Due to this property, pure white can be straining to look at. 

White is great at conveying; hygiene, clarity, purity, cleanliness, sophistication, efficiency, simplicity, etc. On the other hand, it can also come off as; cold, sterile, unfriendly, elitist, etc 

Examples of brand that use white are; Apple, SpaceX, Nike, Adidas, BBC, etc

We’ve covered the positive and negative psychological effects colors have on us above. We’ve also covered how they affect us emotionally and physically. One thing to keep in mind is that these effects are not set in stone. Depending on the various tints, hues and saturations of these colors they can represent other things. So if you see a brand trying to come off calm and intellectual but using red in their brand that doesn't mean it's wrong. To further drive home these psychological effects of color please watch the short video below

## Cultural differences in Color

It’s important to note that even though colors have certain psychological, physical and emotional effects on us, their meaning can differ based on things such as cultural differences and region. 

In western cultures red conveys extreme caution, love, aggression, strength, etc but in China red is seen as a sign of goodluck and happiness. It’s also the color of their flag and of Chinese New Year. In India red is seen as a color of purity which is why it’s common for brides to wear red during their wedding ceremonies. Imagine a hypothetical situation in which you invite your friend from China to your wedding. They can’t make it unfortunately, so in an effort to express how excited and happy they are for you they pen a letter to you in a red envelope. In Chinese culture it’s common for loved ones to give each other red envelopes during Chinese New Year to wish each other goodluck. You aren’t aware of this though so on getting the envelope you start to wonder why your friend would send you a red letter. Do they wish you a horrible married life, did you offend them somehow? Why would your friend send you such a bad omen on your wedding day? Of course we now know that this isn't the case and that your friend was trying to wish you love and happiness but this is a good example of how cultural differences can affect the meaning we place on certain colors. 

As a designer it’s important to note the cultural differences of the meanings behind colors when designing for international audiences. These cultural differences can play a huge role in how products and brands come off to their target audience. So what does this mean for companies that start off with a specific brand color in one market and are trying to move into another market where their brand color may not be so appealing? This doesn’t mean that the company should change their brand colors just to enter the new market. To get around this, they can make the secondary color more prominent than the primary in the design of products that will be used in the new market. Alternatively, they can use a toned down version of the primary color or reduce the use of color altogether and rely heavily on images and illustrations (e.g Airbnb). This is all to say that as we design products, we should be sensitive to how certain aspects of our design, such as color, can have a major impact on how products/ brands are viewed.

## Color Formats

Colors come in different formats depending on where they are being used. In digital/screen design we use RGB values or HEX codes. In print design we use CMYK or Pantone. 

RGB stands for Red, Green and Blue. All colors seen on screens are created by combining different values of these three colors. The values for these three colors can range from 0 - 255. R=0, G=0, B=0 is black while R=255, G=255, B=255 is white. HEX codes are directly correlated to RGB values, the only difference being that HEX codes are shorter and easier to remember. So R=0, G=0, B=0 is the same as HEX code #000000 (black) and R=255, G=255, B=255 is the same as HEX code #FFFFFF (white). As you design UI’s you will most often come across HEX codes. It's important to note that HEX codes always have 6 numbers.

CMYK stands for Cayenne, Magenta, Yellow and Key (black). All colors seen on printed material are created by combining different values of these four colors. CMYK values range from 0 - 100. C=0, M=0, Y=0, K=0 is white while C=0, M=0, Y=0, K=100 is black. Black can also be represented by C=60, M=60, Y=60, K=100. Pantone color formats represent the exact ink mixture required to create particular colors. They are used in cases where colors need to match across different forms of media. Pantone is usually only used by large printers which makes it expensive to print.

CMYK and Pantone colors do not translate directly to RGB values/HEX codes. If you’re given CMYK values to use in digital/screen design use a color converter online to figure out what the corresponding RGB values/HEX codes are. 

## Using Color in UI design and Accessibility

We’ve covered the psychological, physical and emotional effects of colors, the different cultural/regional meanings behind colors and color formats. Finally we’ll cover how to effectively use color in UI design. 

Colors are great at raising the quality and vibrance of designs but when too many colors are used together it can overwhelm viewers and make designs look tacky. Best practice is to use a maximum of two (at the very most three)colors in your UI design. The two (or three) colors you pick need to work well together and complement each other. White, black and gray are seen as neutral colors and should not be included when counting the number of colors used in a design. Assuming you picked two colors to use in your design, one of the colors would be designated primary and the other, secondary.  A good rule of thumb is to use neutral colors in 60% of your design, your primary color in 30% of your design and your secondary color in 10% of your design. The vibrance and quality of your designs will depend on how well you’re able to mix neutral, primary and secondary colors. It’s important to note that within your neutral, primary and secondary colors you can have multiple variants. So if your primary color is blue and secondary is yellow, you can have multiple variants of the blue and yellow color you’ve chosen. These variants can be used for shadows, hover states, disabled buttons, secondary buttons, etc. 

So how do you pick colors that work well together and complement each other? Some people have an eye for this and will just pick colors themselves while others prefer to be more systematic and use tools such as color wheels. Colors wheels are great for choosing figuring out which colors complement each other well and also for creating color variants. There are many color wheel tools online but [Adobe](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) has a great one which provides you with complementary, monochromatic, analogous, triad and many more color combination options.

Another important factor when picking colors is accessibility. We’ll talk more about color accessibility and useful tools in week 4 but it's important to mention it here because it should be factored in at the beginning of your color selection process. We cannot predict the condition of everyone who will interact with our designs once they’ve been built and deployed therefore we need to make sure that our designs are accessible to everyone no matter what condition they have or what medium they choose to interact with our designs. Some people are visually impared and a substantial percentage of the population are color blind. Based on this, we need to ensure that the colors we choose contrast well with each other and the background color (most likely white) of our designs. There are many tools available to help us check these contrasts and ensure that most people, including those with visual impairments, can distinguish between colors in our designs. Like I mentioned above we’ll learn about these tools in week 4.

## What is Typography?

Typography is a part of UI/UX (user interface and user experience) design that involves the use of typefaces ( or font families) to create readable, usable and user-friendly interfaces/ experiences. Good typography enhances users’ digital experiences, optimizes usability, catches users’ attention and has the potential to increase conversion rates. We’ll go into more detail about usability and conversion rates later on in this course.

  Typography is a part of UI/UX (user interface and user experience) design that involves the use of typefaces ( or font families) to create readable, usable and user-friendly interfaces/ experiences. Good typography enhances users’ digital experiences, optimizes usability, catches users’ attention and has the potential to increase conversion rates. We’ll go into more detail about usability and conversion rates later on in this course.
  
  There are many types of typefaces but for this course we’ll focus on the two which are most prevalent in UI design which are Serif and San Serif. 
 
     
  ### Serif and San Serif Typefaces
    
  Serif’s are typefaces which have strokes on them. While sans-serif’s are typefaces which do not have strokes. A good way to remember this is that “serif” translates directly into “stroke” while “sans-serif” translates directly into “no stroke”. Below are examples of serif and sans-serif fonts.
  
  - Examples of serif fonts are **[EB Garamond](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/EB+Garamond)**, **[Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather)**, **[Noto Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Serif)** and **[Source Serif Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Serif+Pro)**.
  -  Examples of sans-serif fonts are **[Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)**, **[Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans)**, **[Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins)** and **[Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans)**.

  ### Fonts
    
  Fonts are the different weights within a typeface (font family). If you were to choose Roboto as a typeface then Roboto regular, medium and bold would be the fonts. 
    
  ### Line Spacing
    
  Line spacing is the vertical height between two lines of text. Typically line spacing should be between 130% - 180% of the font height (when in doubt go for 150%). 
  
  
  ### Kerning
    
  Kerning is the space between each character in a word.
  
  
   ### Tracking
    
  Tracking is the uniform horizontal space between characters in words in a block of text. The main difference between tracking and kerning is that kerning refers to the space between two characters while tracking refers to the space between all characters in a word. 
  
  
  ### Weight, Height and Size
    
  Weight refers to the thickness of a font, height is the vertical space the font occupies and size is how big the font is. These three aspects of a font can be manipulated to show hierarchy within your UI or to bring/reduce focus on certain bodies of text in your UI. We’ll touch more on font heirarchy below.

   ## Principles of Typography
  
  Typography plays an important role in UI/UX design. How typefaces are styled, structured and laid out can make navigating your designs either pleasurable or uncomfortable. Most people do not fully read text while navigating digital products rather they scan through. Reflect back on your experiences while using websites and apps, you may find that you also scan through bodies of text rather than reading them. Based on this, its important that the typfaces we use are styled, structured and laid out in ways that make navigating text in our designs as easy and seamless as possible. Below are guidelines that will help improve typography in your UI design. 
  
  
  ### Hierarchy
  
  Hierarchy can be used to show the order and importance of text on a page. Size, weight, color, contrast and the placement of fonts are great ways to clearly show hierarchy in content. The larger and bolder a font is, the more recognisable it is. If a large, bold, full colored font is placed at the top of a page, its most likely the title of that page. If a small, light weight, grey font is placed somewhere close to the bottom of the page, its most likely a footnote which is not as relevant as the rest of the content on the page. Below are some examples of font hierarchy.

We’ll discuss how color can be used to show hierarchy below.

P.S Common practice is to use a font size of no less than 16px for body content. This is a guide though and can change depending on the typeface.

## Brief
From your assignments in previous lessons and in-class activities your squad should have;

 - chosen a “How Might We”
 - come up with a couple ideas in the form of “Can We”
 - created concepts based on your “Can We”
 - tested these concepts with your classmates

For this assignment, together with other members of your squad, you’ll test your concepts with people outside of the course and Kibo School. The goal is to give you a real life experience of what it’s like to create research assets, recruit research participants, carry out research, gather feedback and generate actionable insights from feedback. 

Each squad will be required to carry out 3 concept tests with 3 different participants. During a concept test, one squad member will act as a facilitator by guiding the participant through the concept test while the other squad members take notes and support in whatever capacity is needed. Each squad member should facilitate at least one concept test. 


## Tools
Before you start recruiting participants it’s important that you have all the tools you need to make your concept tests as seamless as possible for both your squad and participants. Below are the tools you’ll need to carry out your concept test successfully:

 - Your concepts in Google slides
 - Google docs for the script which will narrate what the facilitator will say during the interview and for taking notes during the interview. Each squad should make a copy of this script template and edit as they see fit
 - Google Calendar to schedule dates and times for your concept tests with participants
 - Zoom to carry out your concept tests and record the interview 
 - If you can't record on Zoom - an audio recorder (you can use the audio recorder on your smart device for this)

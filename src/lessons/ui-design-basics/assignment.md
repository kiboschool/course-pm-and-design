## Brief
In the previus lesson, you 
 - chosen a “How Might We”
 - come up with a couple ideas in the form of “Can We”
 - created concepts based on your “Can We”
 - tested these concepts with your classmates

For this assignment, together with other members of your squad, you’ll test your concepts with people outside of the course and Kibo School (real participants). The goal is to give you a real life experience of what it’s like to create research assets, recruit research participants, carry out research, gather feedback and generate actionable insights/takeaways from feedback. 

Each squad will be required to carry out 2 - 4 concept tests with different participants. During a concept test, one squad member will act as a facilitator by guiding the participant through the concept test while the other squad members take notes and support in whatever capacity is needed. Each squad member should facilitate at least one concept test.

From previous lessons and in-class activities, your squad should have:

 - Chosen a ‚ÄúHow Might We‚Äù
 - Ideated solutions in the form of ‚ÄúCan We‚Äù
 - Created concepts based on your ‚ÄúCan We‚Äù
 - Tested these concepts with your classmates

For this project, you‚Äôll test your concepts with people outside of the course and Kibo School (real participants). The goal is for you to experience how to create research assets, recruit research participants, conduct research, and generate actionable insights from feedback. 

You are required to **conduct 3-5 concept tests with different participants in your target audience.** During a concept test, one team member will act as a facilitator by guiding the participant through the concept test. The other team member(s) will take notes and support in whatever capacity is needed. Each squad member should facilitate at least one concept test. 


## Tools
It‚Äôs important that you organize and gather the tools you need to make your tests as seamless as possible for you and participants. Below are the tools you‚Äôll need to carry out your concept test successfully:

 - Your concepts in Google slides 
 - Your test script in Google docs. The script will narrate what the facilitator will say, the questions which will be asked during the interview and will be for taking notes during the interview. 
 - - Make a copy of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15Yrog_oAWJWPjYYlOXfOp8AzBl11bWHeihO5_b00TkE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">this interview guide</a>
 - - Share the copy with all members of your squad, and work to edit and create the guide 
 - Google Calendar which you will use to schedule dates and times for your concept tests with participants
 - Zoom to conduct concept tests and record the interview. Note that your Google Meet education account does not support recording as that is a paid features, so we recommend using Zoom. Alternatively, you may choose to conduct your testing live in person. In this case, it is recommend to use a recorder on your phone or computer to capture what participants say and do. 



## Part 1: Recruit research participants
_Suggested Deadline: January 28, 2023_

Finding and scheduling participants will take time, so you should begin recruting participants right away, before you finalize your concepts and interview guide. 

Feel free to recruit participants from wherever you can. The most important thing is that you agree on a time and date that‚Äôs comfortable for both participants and your squad members. As you recruit participants:
- Let them know what you're recruiting them for (concept testing) and how much of their time you need (each  test should last 30 mins)
- Send calendar invites that include the date, time and  link that will be used for the video call
- Send a reminder the day before to ensure participants show up 


## Part 2: Conduct Concept Tests

During the live test, your participant will give feedback on your concepts. A few tips:
- Ask some background questions to probe the participant's experience of the problem
- As you ask questions, avoid asking closed questions that influence participant's responses
- Give participants enough time to respond but also make sure they don‚Äôt take too much time, remember you only have 30 mins. 


## Part 3: Write a research report

After finishing your concept tests, you will write a research report summarizing your process and findings. The report should include:

 - The "HMW" problem statement and summary of hte problem
 - The roles each of your squad member held during each concept test 
 - The number of people that participated in your concepts tests
 - The dates and times of your concept tests
 - The script you used and questions you asked
 - A summary of the feedback you got during your concept tests 
 - The takeaways you generated from the feedback you got

Use <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WBi6l4EuQRZBNZjVSBODOAkJi4EOlw-LI-nMjMYrsNY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">this template</a> to create your concept test report. Please keep the test report to no more than 3 pages. 


## Submission

#### Ensure your concept test report is set to enable anyone at Kibo to comment on the document 

#### Submit your assignment in Gradescope
- Each team member must submit individually
- In addition to a link to your report, you will answer the following questions about your collaboration:
    -  Summarize your individual contribution to this group assignment/project.
    -  How balanced were the efforts of the group members? Did everyone do his or her fair share of work?
    -  If you had done this by yourself, would the outcome have been better or worse?
    -  Given the choice, would you work with the same group again?
    -  (Optional) Is there anything else you want to share with instructors about the way your team worked together?

#### (3) Download and submit a PDF copy of your report in Woolf

The final project is worth 30% of your final grade for the course. Late submsissions will not be accepted so please submit on time or early. 

## Product Design and Presentation

In collaboration with your team members, you will design a solution to a given user problem.  You need to submit three artifacts for your final project:

- A complete product requirements document (15% of grade)
- A prototype, built in Figma, with original UI designs for your product (10% of grade)
- A recorded presentation (maximum of 7 minutes) explaining the problem, user research and product development process, and final product vision (5% of grade)

## Collaboration recommendations
The final project has many moving pieces, so you should plan your strategy and collaboration. Below is a suggested approach which you may feel free to modify to better suit your team. 

### Determine how you will split up the work 
The final project has three major deliverables (PRD, Design, Video). Decide who will be the owner for each deliverable. The owner does not need to do all the work, but should be in charge of creating a timeline, splitting up the work, ensuring the work is done, and putting together the final artifact. 

### Part 1: Agree on a product direction and start the PRD
As a team, determine a direction for your product. To do so:

- Copy the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1e8IXhSMGBr-EMdVvuHOlX6qfgNINvby5_FRDNIMQmZg/edit" target="_blank"> roadmap template from lesson 6.3 </a>
  - Use the template to determine what feature(s) will go into your MVP, MMP and MLP and your roadmap
  - You *do not* have to submit the template though you may link to it in your PRD if you wish
- Copy <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uYfwNyXAwu-8-uIQaEGmtt6ZkiztkaaCxHe_XUpPu5U/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">this PRD template </a> . This is the suggested template to use for your final project, but you may also choose to use a different format. 
  - <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jn-LthvbfhhXjgFwmBImNeozgXrjalPM28sg7UYhGOo/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Here</a> is an example of a completed PRD using the template 
  - You may choose to a use different PRD template if you wish. Whatever format you choose must include the following
    - Summary of the problem, solution, and roadmap
    - Background section that briefly describes the problem your product is solving
    - Links to supporting documents including your Figma designs and concept test report
    - List of major features with brief descriptions
    - Roadmap that list what you will release when
- Draft the background section of the PRD 

### Part 2: Complete design prototype
You have started working on designs for your final project in the [App Design](/app-designs) project. You will now finish your designs. The finished product requires:
- Designing the remaining major UI screens for your solution 
  - The UI screens you design should show how users will interact with/flow through the major features in your product
  - You do not have to design every single screen and should leave out the basics (e.g account, profile, password reset, etc). Instead focus on the primary features and interactions of your app 
- Building an interactive prototype in Figma. The prototype should allow someone to click through your app and mimic its behavior

### Part 3: Complete the PRD 
Complete the PRD for the MVP version of your product. Suggested order to work on the PRD is:
- Background 
- Roadmap
- Detailed requirements 
  - This is a list of all the features in your MVP as well as descriptions of how each feature should work
- Technical requirements
- Summary and Supporting documents -- leave this until the end when you have finished the rest of the parts

### Part 4: Record a pitch video
You will be recording a product pitch. The audience for this pitch are potential collaborators or investors. The pitch should clearly demonstrate:
- The problem your product solves
- Your team
- The UI designs and main functionality
- Why you believe your product will gain traction
- Your "ask" of the viewer 

When finished, upload your pitch video to YouTube. 

## Submission

#### (1) Submit in Gradescope
- This is a group assignment and one group member should submit for the entire team. A few notes on artifacts
  - Ensure your PRD is set to enable anyone at Kibo to comment on the document 
  - Ensure that your YouTube video is unlisted and viewable in YouTube

#### (2) Submit a collaboration evaluation
Submit <a href="https://forms.gle/QcYXFq5SysjjaH3RA" target="_blank"> this form </a>to summarize your contribution and that of your team members. The form will ask you to answer the following questions about your collaboration:
 -  Summarize your individual contribution to this group assignment/project.
 -  How balanced were the efforts of the group members? Did everyone do his or her fair share of work?
-  If you had done this by yourself, would the outcome have been better or worse?
-  Given the choice, would you work with the same group again?
 -  (Optional) Is there anything else you want to share with instructors about the way your team worked together?

#### (3) Download and submit the following to Woolf
Each team member should submit the following to Woolf:
- A PDF copy of your PRD
- A PDF copy of your designs. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTk28NTGdkU" target="_blank"> video instructions </a> for how to get a PDF copy of design files
- File of your video presentation


#### (4) Submit your course evaluation
We want your candid feedback on the course. We are "iterating toward greatness" can can only do so if we get a bit better each time.
